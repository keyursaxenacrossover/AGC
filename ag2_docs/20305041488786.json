This guide focuses on various techniques and protocols to improve email authentication and reduce the likelihood of legitimate emails being marked as spam.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#general\">General Information</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#spf\">SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#dkim\">DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#dmarc\">DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#whitelisting\">Whitelisting</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#blacklisting\">Blacklisting</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#external-mailserver\">External Mailserver</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mail-reputation\">Mail Reputation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#gmail-yahoo-changes\">Gmail and Yahoo Changes (February 2024)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"general\">General Information</h2>\n<p>Before an email appears in the recipient's inbox, it has to overcome several hurdles. The increasing measures for protection against spam can sometimes filter out desired emails. With spam accounting for more than 90 percent of total mail volume, both email providers and recipients are forced to take extensive countermeasures.</p>\n<p>To check the IP addresses for mails, refer to the <a href=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20384449907602\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Hurricane Socketlabs MTA Overview</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>For official documentation on how to avoid invitations ending up in the spam folder, please refer to the customer-facing<a href=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20231558003602\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Good Mail – Bad Mail: How to Avoid Invitations Ending up in the Spam Folder</a> guide.</p>\n<h2 id=\"spf\">SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</h2>\n<p>SPF is an email authentication method that specifies which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of your domain.</p>\n<p>Add the following SPF record to your domain's DNS settings in order to implement SPF checks:</p>\n<code>include:_spf.tivian.com</code>\n<p>For a detailed breakdown of the IPs included in this SPF record, visit: <a href=\"https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=spf%3a_spf.tivian.com&amp;run=toolpage\">MX Toolbox SPF Lookup</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that using IP addresses instead of FQDN's is also possible, however, not at all recommended, as IP addresses are subject to change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dkim\">DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)</h2>\n<p>DKIM adds a digital signature to your emails that is associated with your domain and used for all outgoing emails.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3QC5JPB7NS4M9VT2ZYF6YH0\">How to check DKIM</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit <a href=\"https://mxtoolbox.com/dkim.aspx\">MX Toolbox DKIM Lookup</a>\n</li>\n<li>Enter your domain</li>\n<li>Use \"tivian\" or \"qb\" as the selector</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"dmarc\">DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance)</h2>\n<p>DMARC is a specification developed to reduce email abuse. It builds upon SPF and DKIM.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3QC5JPBK0PQYZ4B7D409V4Z\">How to check DMARC</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit <a href=\"https://mxtoolbox.com/DMARC.aspx\">MX Toolbox DMARC Lookup</a>\n</li>\n<li>Enter your domain in the search field</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> DMARC is only effective when SPF and DKIM are already set up.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"whitelisting\">Whitelisting</h2>\n<p>Whitelists are positive lists that certify a listed sender with a special reputation and ensure preferential treatment of their emails by email providers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blacklisting\">Blacklisting</h2>\n<p>Blacklisting involves blocking IP addresses of email addresses that have been classified as spammers due to suspicious behavior. These IP addresses are placed on a blacklist and emails from them are not delivered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"external-mailserver\">External Mailserver</h2>\n<p>Customers can use their own mail server or mailing infrastructure for sending emails. If customers use their own mail server, you can verify this by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Finding the following in Globis under 'Modules': use_hurricane_mta hurricane_snailmail_port</li>\n<li>On the installation: <strong>Options &gt; Mail-Admin &gt; Mail-Report</strong> , if the columns <strong>Rejected</strong>, <strong>Not delivered</strong>, <strong>Not reachable</strong> are missing here, then this is also an indication that an external mail server is being used.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3QC5JPBH139TA96KRMD6ZTN\">How to set up an external mailserver</h3>\n<p>To set up an external mailserver, the customer needs to provide the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Server/Host</li>\n<li>Port</li>\n<li>Account/User</li>\n<li>Password</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some instances, the customer mailserver would require some whitelisting of IP's to allow relaying. In this case, you can refer to <a href=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20384907492370\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Outgoing NAT IP addresses productive environments</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"mail-reputation\">Mail Reputation</h2>\n<p>You can test the reputation of your emails using tools like <a href=\"https://www.mail-tester.com\">Mail Tester</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First call up the mail template on the installation: <strong>Preview button (top left) &gt; Send test mail</strong> and enter the mail address specified by the Mail Tester tool here</li>\n<li>Then check the result in the Mail Tester. (The result sometimes takes a while)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"gmail-yahoo-changes\">Gmail and Yahoo Changes (February 2024)</h2>\n<p>Starting February 1st, 2024, Gmail and Yahoo will implement mandatory requirements for email authentication and spam prevention.
