In that cases Okta does not know the context - especially the app - in which the user action happens. Therefore the redirect after the action will lead to a default page.</p><p>This can be changes using a “fromURI” field for the respective link in the e-mail as query parameter. It will have the value of the URL to the page that the user should be redirected after the action is done.</p><p><u>Example:</u></p><pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;a href=\"{activationLink}?fromURI=http://google.com\"&gt;Activate your account&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>",
