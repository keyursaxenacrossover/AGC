The implementation of an authentication solution is not part of the core business of Tivian and is a generic component. The solution should follow standards as much as possible to enable changes later on.</p><p></p><p>The solution will be build around a central identity provider that proxies all kinds on authentications but no authorization in depth. That identity provider will hold credentials information. All kinds of user synchronization will be routed through an adapter that will support queue based operations and abstract the specific identity provider implementation. The OIDC standard will be used as internal authentication protocoll between identity provider and respective application.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",
