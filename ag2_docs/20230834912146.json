    "body": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 2.1em;\">Overview</span></p>\n<article>\n<p>This article explains the meaning of specific codes (0, -66, -77, and -99) that may appear in your data set. Understanding these codes is crucial for correctly interpreting survey responses and managing data in Questback projects.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK\">Information</h1>\n<p>The codes 0, -66, -77, and -99 are used to represent different scenarios in survey responses, particularly for project variables of type v_000. Each code has a specific meaning depending on the context and type of question.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01HGKSMPRT0YJGQ3QZJXD4KCNM\">Understanding the Codes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01HGKSMPRT8YFVQX7YJXBXKP4T\">Special Considerations for Text Boxes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01HGKSMPRTG0JQXQXCXVXJ1QD6\">Customizing Missing Response Values</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRT0YJGQ3QZJXD4KCNM\">Understanding the Codes</h2>\n<p>The codes in your data set have the following meanings:</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRTMXJ8QXHXHXJ1QD7\">Code 0</h3>\n<p>For project variables of type v_000 (except text boxes): The respondent has seen the question but has not edited it.</p>\n<p>For respondent management variables of the \"text box\" type: This indicates a pre-filled entry where the variable has not been filled.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRTQXJ8QXHXHXJ1QD8\">Code -66</h3>\n<p>For project variables of type v_000 that refer to text boxes: The respondent has not seen the question concerned because it was hidden.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRTUXJ8QXHXHXJ1QD9\">Code -77</h3>\n<p>For project variables of type v_000 (except text boxes): The respondent has not seen the question concerned. This could be because they aborted the survey or because they were not shown the question/page due to filter settings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRTYYJ8QXHXHXJ1QDA\">Code -99</h3>\n<p>For project variables of type v_000 that refer to text boxes: The respondent has seen the question but has not edited it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRT8YFVQX7YJXBXKP4T\">Special Considerations for Text Boxes</h2>\n<p>For text boxes, the code -99 indicates that a respondent has seen a question but has not answered it. This is different from the meaning of -99 for other types of questions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRTG0JQXQXCXVXJ1QD6\">Customizing Missing Response Values</h2>\n<p>It's important to note that you have the ability to set the \"missing response\" values within the exported data sets yourself. This allows for customization based on your specific project needs.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863\">FAQ</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRTK0JQXQXCXVXJ1QD7\">What does it mean if I see a 0 in my data set?</h3>\n<p>For most variables, it means the respondent saw the question but didn't edit it. For text box variables in respondent management, it indicates a pre-filled entry that wasn't changed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRTM0JQXQXCXVXJ1QD8\">How do I interpret -66 in my results?</h3>\n<p>The code -66 is specific to text box questions and means the respondent didn't see the question because it was hidden.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRTQ0JQXQXCXVXJ1QD9\">What's the difference between -77 and -99 for text boxes?</h3>\n<p>-77 means the respondent didn't see the question at all (e.g., due to survey abortion or filtering), while -99 means they saw the question but didn't answer it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRTV0JQXQXCXVXJ1QDA\">Can I change these codes in my exported data?</h3>\n<p>Yes, you can set custom \"missing response\" values in your exported data sets to suit your analysis needs.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n</article>",
