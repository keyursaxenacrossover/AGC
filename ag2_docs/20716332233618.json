    "body": "<h1 id=\"h_01J6F4G80J7KQ23WGXB9P283T1\">Overview</h1>\n<p>This article provides an in-depth analysis of the Okta Agent and its role in federating with client Identity Providers (IdPs). It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using the Okta Agent, particularly in scenarios where clients require integration with their existing IAM or SSO solutions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For the Okta Agent the add-on “Directory Integration” is required which we did not include in our package</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20716341552274\" alt=\"Blank Diagram - with Native AD support.png\"></p>\n<p>When <strong>federating</strong> with <strong>clients Identity Providers</strong> (also called IAM/SSO solutions) the following is <strong>important</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Identity Providers</strong> can be <strong>cloud hosted</strong> (e.g: a service provider) or <strong>on-premise</strong> (e.g: a software like Gluu <a href=\"https://www.gluu.org/\">https://www.gluu.org/</a>) <br>→ <strong>Both could be connected</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Identity Providers</strong> must have the <strong>ability to authenticate other apps</strong> (in this case our Okta Identity Provider is also an app in the perspective of a client) via the protocol <strong>OpenID Connect</strong> or <strong>SAML 2.0</strong><br>→ <strong>If not, we can not federate with them</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The<strong> identity provider</strong> must be <strong>publicly available</strong>. If Okta can not reach it, there can be no connection established between Okta and the Identity Provider. In theory this is not required for SAML integrations but this is not tested.<br>→ <strong>If not, we can not federate with them</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general: If all requirements are met, we should be able to integrate with a client.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Okta is a cloud-hosted service that supports both SAML and OpenID Connect and is publicly available for everyone on the internet Federate Other IDPGreen</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Azure AD (like our Tivian AD) is also a cloud-hosted service (Azure Cloud) and supports at least OpenID Connect (SAML not tested) and is publicly available for everyone on the internet (does not require our VPN) Federate Other IDPGreen</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Active Directory (<strong>NOT Azure Active Directory) </strong>is hosted on-premise, commonly in a private network of a company and (AFAIK) does not support OpenID Connect or SAML. It can not be connected to without some kind of <strong>“AD Connector” </strong>Not possibleRed</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services) is like a plugin / extra service for Active Directory which a.) enables support for SAML and b.) can be made publicly available by allowing internet traffic to be passed through the firewall for the ADFS service only (for example). This is what we call <strong>AD Connector </strong>in the diagram. The client can always install ADFS on his own and integrate with us afterwards. Expose ADGreen</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For example, Essentials has documentation on how to configure ADFS for SSO with essentials (<a href=\"https://web2.questback.com/downloads/ESS-SSO-ADFS.pdf\">https://web2.questback.com/downloads/ESS-SSO-ADFS.pdf</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Okta Agent is similar to ADFS. It is installed in the infrastructure of the client for the purpose of exposing the AD to the public and supporting protocols like SAML or OpenID Connect. Expose AD with Okta AgentBlue</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"header-1\">Pros of the Okta Agent</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>More clients could be supported for the SSO module in EFS</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Offers more features than “a normal ADFS” e.g: synchronizing profiles from AD to Okta</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"header-3\">Cons of the Okta Agent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Costs more money (starting at 21k / year, we also paid more for the other add-ons than advertised)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The same thing (solving that ADs can be used for the scoped use cases) can be achieved with other tools (see ADFS)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We have not tested this yet and this will definitely <strong>increase the scope</strong> till December (at least from a testing perspective, since it will be hard to setup such a setting)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additional features will be hard to support since this is not a common feature for Identity Providers speaking SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
