It covers the setup, configuration, and management of these tools for project managers and users responsible for follow-up processes.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Information</h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">The Action Planner allows monitoring and administrating the follow-up process in employee surveys post-result reports. Local administrators manage the process for individual units, while a project team oversees the organization-wide process. Integrated into the Org Processor of EFS Employee, it leverages functionalities already implemented in the employee survey. This guide covers the typical steps of a follow-up process, navigation in the organizational structure, creating and managing actions, and configuring various settings for project managers.</p>\n<ul class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">\n<li><a href=\"#h_01J3N2HWA9CB94W7QH6NK2VPNQ\">First Orientation in the Org Processor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01J3N2HWA989ZD8NWRWWZAQ561\">Creating and Managing Actions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01J3N3C3QVWD5MSJ5D2C1GWB7E\">Project Manager Instructions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01J3N2HWABDD8AZMZNFRMPQGSQ\">Creating and Configuring the Task Trigger</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"ak-editor-panel cc-tqp4ke wysiwyg-text-align-justify\" data-panel-type=\"info\">\n<div class=\"ak-editor-panel__content\">\n<p><strong>Typical steps of a follow-up process</strong></p>\n<p>Usually, a follow-up process is separated in two phases: The project manager prepares the <em>Action Planner</em> and starts the follow-up process. The following steps are necessary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Activating the <em>Action Planner</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Configuring the <em>Action Planner</em> (e.g. creating subject groups)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Activating <em>CLF</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Configuring <em>CLF</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Inviting responsible persons</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The responsible persons of the individual units work with the <em>Action Planner</em>.

Two options are available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>simply copying the selected action into a single target unit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>multiple copying of the action into the units of a neighboring branch. It is up to you to decide from which “starting point” downwards the subunits of the branch should be filled with copies, and to which level depth. Up to three levels are possible.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All copying actions will be logged in detail in the copy log file of the source action. Proceed as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Locate the action you want to copy and click on the <strong>Copy</strong> icon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Define the target of the copying process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Individual target unit</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Target area</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the next dialog, describe the target area more closely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you have selected “Individual target unit”, all you need to do is select that target unit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you have selected “Target area”, define the starting point and the level depth for the copying process.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Confirm by clicking on <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The action is copied. In the copying log, an entry will be made for every individual copy action.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3N2HWA9R2D0MNRR8C0E01ED\"><strong>Moving actions</strong></h3>\n<p>Now and then, it is necessary to change the unit of an action retroactively. Instead of deleting the action in the old unit and creating it anew in the next unit, you can simply move it. Proceed as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Locate the action you want to move and click on the <strong>Move action</strong> icon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the field “Move action x to unit” you can select the target unit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To do so, click on the<strong> binoculars</strong> icon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This prompts a list of all available units. Browse this list and select the desired new parent unit by clicking on Select.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Confirm by clicking on <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The moving of actions requires the right<em> actionplanner_transfer</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3N2HWA9XEZZVBNGAP61ABDX\"><strong>Subscribing to reminder emails</strong></h3>\n<p>Optionally, the project manager can activate the automated dispatch of reminder email. If the function is configured for individual-related dispatch, the reminders will be sent to the creator of the respective unit automatically.

By clicking the paragraph icon of a role, you reach the Rights Administration displaying the rights of each role. For tasks and <em>CLF</em>, the following rights under the section <strong>Follow-Up - Action Planner</strong> are important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>comment_create</em>: Right to add new comments to tasks and edit or delete own comments</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>comment_moderate</em>: Right to edit or delete any comment in relation to tasks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>workflow_use</em>: Right to see and use workflows</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>view_survey_result</em>: Right to access survey results</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may adapt the rights of the standard roles in the Rights administration according to your needs and use case. By clicking the button <strong>Create role</strong>, you can create new additional roles with certain rights.</p>\n<p>When creating new roles, the respective labels of roles, e.g. “Owner”, can be identical, making it hard to distinguish between different Owners with identical names. However, the bracketed abbreviation behind the label has to be unique.</p>\n<p><strong>Creating users and assigning them to their organizational unit</strong></p>\n<p>Under <strong>Org Processor</strong> → <strong>Org processor users</strong>, you can import already built organizational structures or create Org processor users as well as their assignments to units manually.</p>\n<p><strong>Create new master data</strong></p>\n<p>For the synchronization of Org Processor users and panelists, you need the use of master data. You can either use existing master data or create new ones. Using master data and subsequently synchronizing them is recommended. This way, you don‘t have to manage these user data on both sides - in the Org Processor and in the panel. For creating new master data, go to<strong> People → Master data →</strong> <strong>Create master data</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Create a panel group through </strong><em><strong>Employee</strong></em><strong> Import</strong></p>\n<p>Under <strong>People</strong> → <strong>Panelist administration</strong> → <strong>Panelists import from Employee project</strong>, a new panel group has to be created in the context of the project setup.</p>\n<p><strong>Setting up the synchronization</strong></p>\n<p>To transfer the data of the panel groups to the organizational structure, the <em>Employee</em> synchronization is available. To set up the synchronization, go to<strong> People → Groups → </strong>[Select group] →<strong> Employee-Sync</strong> → <strong>Add Employee-Sync job</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here, the following information is required: select your<em> Employee</em> project as well as the master-data variable storing the respective assignment of panelists to their roles and unit. Roles and units are quoted in the following format: [ROLE ABBREVIATION]:[metaname(s) of organizational unit(s)]. Different roles are separated by semicolons, and different units by commas. Example: OWN:unit1; SUP:unit2, unit3, unit4.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21017112885394\" alt=\"image2019-5-15_11-31-12.png\"></p>\n<p>For a successful synchronization, the panelists of the group need a master data variable with at least one role and unit assignment.</p>\n<p>The synchronization of each Employee project runs once a day. In case you want to make changes to Org Processor users, you will therefore have to wait one day. During the synchronization, all existing roles and units are deleted before being created again. Therefore, it is not recommended to make changes to the users manually. Correct roles and units are transferred, and incomplete roles and units remain deleted.</p>\n<p>On errors during the synchronization, an e-mail is sent to the job creator. The error of the last synchronization can be viewed by going to <strong>People</strong> → <strong>Groups</strong> → [Select group] → <strong>Employee-Sync</strong> as well as by editing a job.</p>\n<p>There can be only one synchronization setup for each Employee project - and vice versa, each group can be synchronized to several Employee projects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3N2HWAAQCQZKBMDAYT5AWZM\"><strong>Displaying the originator of an action</strong></h3>\n<p>It is possible to display in the Action Planner who has created an action. This improves transparency and traceability in the follow-up process. To do so, open the <strong>Org Processor</strong> → <strong>Configuration</strong> → <strong>Action Planner configuration</strong> menu and activate the “Show originator of an action” option on the <strong>Settings</strong> tab.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21017112886034\" alt=\"image2019-5-15_13-4-9.png\"></p>\n<p>Now, an additional “Created by” column will be displayed in the overview of actions of a unit, showing to you and your Action Planner users who have created a specific action. The detailed views of actions and the exported list of actions contain this information, too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3N2HWAA8TPCWSVT6MVC0G5B\"><strong>Creating subject groups</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Action Planner</em> actions are usually allocated to subject groups which are defined by the project management beforehand. In many cases, these subject groups correspond to subjects that have already been used in the questionnaire to group questions, for example, “Leadership culture”, “Working conditions” etc. But you can also choose subject groups that have been defined as fields of development for the organization based on the survey results.</p>\n<p><strong>Accessing subject groups</strong></p>\n<p>To find the existing subject groups of your project, open the <strong>Org Processor</strong> → <strong>Configuration</strong> → <strong>Action Planner configuration → Subject groups</strong> menu. A “Default subject group” exists per default.</p>\n<p>The subject groups can be imported and exported in Excel or CSV files. For the import, use the button <strong>Import subject groups</strong>, for the export, use the <strong>Excel export</strong> or <strong>CSV expor</strong>t buttons.</p>\n<p>Via the button<strong> View</strong>, you can select and deselect the languages in which the subject groups shall be displayed. You can also select the number of rows per page.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21017142424466\" alt=\"image2019-5-15_13-12-51.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Editing subject groups</strong></p>\n<p>To edit the existing subject groups, use the icons in the “Actions” column:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Click on the Edit icon to open the dialog shown above and change the label.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delete</strong>: Additional subject groups can be deleted. The default subject group cannot be deleted.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Creating new subject groups</strong></p>\n<p>To create an additional subject group, proceed as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Click on the <strong>Create subject group</strong> button.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter the English and/or German name of the subject group.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Decide if the subject group should be selectable. This is usually the case for newlycreated subject groups. Deactivating selectability is an option if, for example, a subject group is deprecated and you do not want users to allocate further actions to it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click on the <strong>Save</strong> button.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3N2HWAAAPSTGS6JN1DPBC4R\"><strong>Setting up automated dispatch of status e-mails</strong></h3>\n<p>Optionally, you can set up status e-mails that provide regular information on the progress of the follow-up process. The <em>Action Planner</em> users can subscribe to these status e-mails for their area of responsibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<p>A status e-mail contains an overview of measures for the current organizational unit and its subunits (section “Information”) and additional status overviews by subject groups.</p>\n<p>Organizational unit: Sample Company C Inc. (US-C100-001)</p>\n<p>Subject group: Default subject group</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>-------------------------------------</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Number of actions: 9</p>\n<p>Not started: 5</p>\n<p>Started: 0</p>\n<p>Reopened: 0</p>\n<p>Completed: 4</p>\n<p>Subject group: Teamarbeit</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>-------------------------------------</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Number of actions: 6</p>\n<p>Not started: 2</p>\n<p>Started: 4</p>\n<p>Reopened: 0</p>\n<p>Completed: 0</p>\n<p>Information:</p>\n<p>Total number of actions: 15</p>\n<p>Total number of reopened actions: 0</p>\n<p>Total number of organizational units: 1</p>\n<p>Mean number of actions: 15</p>\n<p>In addition to the status e-mails, you can send automated reminders to the responsible persons before the completion date of an action is reached.</p>\n<p><strong>Creating a mail template for the status e-mail</strong></p>\n<p>As for other automated dispatch processes, the content of the status e-mail is defined via a mail template. In the <strong>Options</strong> → <strong>Mail templates</strong> menu, create a new mail template. Please mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Select the “Org Processor mail” type.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dedicated wildcards #overview_action_german# and #overview_action_english# are available for the status e-mails.

Navigate via the following path to the variable editor of the <em>Action Planner</em>:</p>\n<p><strong>Org Processor</strong> → <strong>Configuration</strong> →<strong> Action Planner Configuration</strong> → <strong>Action Planner variables</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21017112889362\" alt=\"image2019-5-15_14-11-42.png\"></p>\n<p>When creating a new variable, you can select different display types like Text field, Checkbox, Image and Hyperlink. Self-created variables generated for the <em>Action Planner</em> are automatically labeled with the prefix ac_.</p>\n<p>To hide or display variables in the exterior view, set the setting “Show the content of this variable” to “no” or “yes”.</p>\n<p>In editing mode, you can change the label of self-created variables. You can also decide whether you want to “Allow editing of the content of this variable” or “Show the content of this variable” or not.</p>\n<p>With the arrows on the right, you can change the order of variables in the variable editor and respectively change the order of variables in the exterior view.</p>\n<p><strong>Variables in</strong><em><strong> the Task List</strong></em></p>\n<p>All <em>Action Planner</em> variables (ac-variables), including self-created variables, can be displayed in the exterior view of <em>Task List</em> in <em>Portals</em>. With the new display types <strong>Image</strong> and <strong>Hyperlink</strong>, links to images or other pages can be created in the exterior view of Task List in Portals. To provide the display types in the exterior view of Task List in Portals, you want to create the respective variables in the variable editor of the <em>Action Planner</em> first.</p>\n<p>The display types Image and Hyperlink can only be used in the <em>Portals</em> page module <em>Task List</em>. They have no influence on the exterior view of the Org Processor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3N2HWABAW4E4TAB20761TZM\"><strong>History log for tasks</strong></h3>\n<p>Each task has a history log in which all modifications to this task are chronologically stored. The information stored in the history log of tasks is only viewable in <em>Task List</em> of <em>Portals</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3N2HWAB9EC9WW5CDV63H3FP\"><strong>Workflows</strong></h3>\n<p>The workflow buttons are an important feature when working on tasks. Workflows enable you to assign, escalate, close and reopen tasks as well as invite participants to follow-up surveys. Workflows can be added and configured for each of the three status Not started - Started - Completed to define the availability of the different workflows for each status.</p>\n<p><strong>Configuring workflows</strong></p>\n<p>To configure workflows, navigate via the following path to the workflows of the <em>Action Planner</em>:</p>\n<p><strong>Org Processor</strong> → <strong>Configuration</strong> →  <strong>Action Planner configuration</strong> → <strong>Workflow</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21017142425618\" alt=\"image2019-5-15_14-25-44.png\"></p>\n<p>Via the <strong>Add</strong> button and the<strong> trash</strong> icon, you can add workflows to the different statuses and remove them again. Linked workflows are configurable for the respective status. Configured and therefore applicable workflows have a green radio button in the column “Executable” - a red radio button however labels workflows that are not configured and therefore not executable. The order of workflows can be adapted via drag and drop and determines the order of workflow buttons in the exterior view.</p>\n<p><strong>Creating mail templates for workflows</strong></p>\n<p>Some workflows require <strong>mail templates</strong>. Mail templates for workflows need to be saved as individual project templates in order to be available for workflows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate via the following path to the mail templates for your project:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[Selected project] → <strong>Mail templates</strong> → <strong>New draft</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Create a new mail template. Please consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Select the “Org Processor mail” type.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Via the following path, you‘ll find all Action Planner variables available. Here, you can add new variables, adapt all variables and you can use these variables as wildcards in your mail template:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[Selected project] → <strong>Org Processor</strong> →<strong> Configuration</strong> → <strong>Action Planner configuration</strong> → <strong>Action Planner variables</strong></p>\n<p>To use Action Planner variables as wildcards in your mail template, enclose the relevant variable label with two hash signs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The wildcard #action_comment# is especially dedicated to workflow e-mails. By using this wildcard in the mail template, comments within workflows can be included in e-mails to be sent. These wildcards can be found in the section <strong>Mail text</strong> of the new draft by clicking on the question mark icon.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example for a mail text within a mail template:</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Hello #ac_resonse#,</p>\n<p>a new task #ac_name# has been created:</p>\n<p>http://www.example-efs.com/APortalsName/#ac_id#</p>\n<p>Please take care of it.</p>\n<p>Best regards,</p>\n<p>the system</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The link in this email text is the same for all workflow mail templates. Upon execution of workflows with e-mail dispatch, the wildcard ID in this link is replaced by the actual ID of the relevant task. Via this link, the responsible person is led directly to the assigned task.</p>\n<p>By clicking on the question mark icon, a list of available wildcards for setting mail templates is shown.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>After having completed the mail template, confirm with <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optionally, you can view the e-mail of your mail template in preview mode by clicking on the button <strong>Preview</strong> on the top left side of the draft.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To allocate the new mail template to the current project, go back to the <strong>Mail templates</strong> menu and switch the assignment status of your mail template in the column <strong>Project template</strong> from “No” to “Yes” by clicking on the status link.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The new mail template is now available for your project within the workflows.</p>\n<p><strong>Configuring the workflow “Assign to”</strong></p>\n<p>This workflow allows the assignment of tasks to users, who receive a respective notification via e-mail.

Depending on how a survey participant has answered a certain question, the<em> Task Trigger</em> creates a task in the<em> Action Planner</em> which has been predefined for this purpose. The<em> Task Trigger</em> can be created on any page of the survey project. If the <em>Task Trigger</em> is created on the final page, for example, it will be triggered upon completion of the survey. The <em>Task Trigger</em> is configured on the basis of a selected Employee project storing the required organizational structure and the respective Action module the <em>Task Trigger</em> accesses when triggering the task. A number of conditions and settings define if a task is created and what content is stored in this task. The target unit for a task needs to be provided in a variable of the originating survey. In case a unit cannot be found, a survey runtime error is thrown and the survey‘s error notification recipients will be notified. The survey wildcards can be used to dynamically fill Action Planner variables. Conditions can be defined to provide different content based on predefined rules. Default fields for defining the task cannot be removed and must have a value.</p>\n<p>To create the Task Trigger, proceed as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate via the following path to the Task Trigger in your survey project:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[Selected project] → <strong>Questionnaire editor</strong> → [Selected page] → <strong>Triggers</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Trigger list is opened.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click on the button <strong>+ Trigger</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter a<strong> Title</strong> for the trigger into the text field.
