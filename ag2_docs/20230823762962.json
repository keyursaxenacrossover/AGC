    "body": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 2.1em;\">Overview</span></p>\n<article>\n<p>This article explains how to transfer a survey project from one license or account to another in Questback. It covers the export and import process, as well as important considerations when transferring projects.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK\">Information</h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Select “Project” from the export menu. You can then store the .gpx file on your computer. Your project is now stored in compressed form as a .gpx file. In order to import this project, you now have to click on “New project” in the new license/account and then switch to the “Import project” tab. Here, you can then upload the .gpx file and thus transfer it to the new license/account.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRT3BXQJ8YJCGX9WNKM\">Important Considerations</h2>\n<p>When transferring a survey project, keep in mind the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The survey link changes during the import process.</li>\n<li>If you have already sent the original link to test users, you have two options:\n<ol>\n<li>Send the new link to all test users</li>\n<li>Keep the old project active to maintain the original link</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863\">FAQ</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRT9PAQP4D4ILC5BSQQ\">Will my survey responses be transferred with the project?</h3>\n<p>This article doesn't specifically address the transfer of survey responses. It's recommended to check with Questback support for information on transferring survey data along with the project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRT0QBQQ5E5JMD6CTRR\">Can I transfer a project between different versions of Questback?</h3>\n<p>The guide doesn't mention version compatibility. It's best to ensure both the source and destination accounts are using compatible versions of Questback before attempting a transfer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</article>",
