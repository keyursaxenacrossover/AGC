This generic domain is created automatically and cannot be manipulated. It always includes SSL and is provided at no extra cost to the customer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tivian_options\">Tivian's Domain Offerings</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Custom domain</strong> from .customervoice360.com (e.g., bounty.customervoice360.com) with SSL included.

If there's no error message and you see a green lock next to the URL, the domain has SSL.</p>\n<h3 id=\"01J3YV9D4F46J292RCYV9V4TTE\">What is an Alias?</h3>\n<p>An alias is a second domain name for an existing website. For example, if the generic domain is ab1234.customervoice360.com, an alias could be i-love-kitkat.com. The alias points to the generic domain, displaying the same page.</p>\n<h3 id=\"custom_url_alias\">What is a \"custom URL Alias managed by Tivian\"?</h3>\n<p>This likely refers to sub-domains of a customer's main domain (e.g., www.kundendomain.de, umfrage.kundendomain.de) managed by Tivian. These should be treated as separate aliases due to potential for unlimited sub-domains.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scenario_costs\">What are the costs associated with different scenarios?</h3>\n<p>Costs vary depending on the scenario, including domain registration, renewal, SSL certificates, and additional setup processes. Scenario 1 incurs the least costs, while Scenario 4 is preferred by Tivian for maximum control and minimal customer communication.</p>\n</article>",
