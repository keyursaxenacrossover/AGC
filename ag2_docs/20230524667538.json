Try clicking the invitation link again or verifying that the URL is complete.</p>\n<h3 id=\"faq2\">How can I prevent participants from being asked for access codes?</h3>\n<p>Enable the \"Allow parallel access\" option in your survey settings under Login Options. This can help prevent issues caused by email URL scanners and other security features.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</article>",
