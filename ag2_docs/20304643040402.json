It outlines the prerequisites, requirements, and important considerations for implementing TIVIAN Access.\n</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK\">Information</h1>\n<p>\n  This guide focuses on the TIVIAN Access module, its ordering process, and the critical requirements for its implementation.\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#tivian_access_module\">TIVIAN Access Module</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#implementation_requirements\">Implementation Requirements</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#important_considerations\">Important Considerations</a>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"tivian_access_module\">TIVIAN Access Module</h2>\n<p>\n  TIVIAN Access is an optional add-on module that can be integrated into our software package. Here's what you need to know:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>It's an optional feature that enhances our software capabilities.</li>\n  <li>To order TIVIAN Access, visit: <a href=\"https://ww2.umfragecenter.de/uc/order_survey/\">https://ww2.umfragecenter.de/uc/order_survey/</a>\n</li>\n  <li>Navigate to <code>modules &gt; TIVIAN SSO</code> to place your order.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"implementation_requirements\">Implementation Requirements</h2>\n<p>\n  Before proceeding with the implementation of TIVIAN Access, there are two critical requirements that must be met:\n</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"test_user_agreement\">1. Mandatory Test User Agreement</h3>\n<p>\n  It is absolutely essential to have a test user agreement in place before selling this module. Key points include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A mandatory test user must be provided (e.g., TivianSSO@customerdomain.com).</li>\n  <li>This requirement is non-negotiable.</li>\n  <li>Failure to provide a test user can result in service disruptions if changes need to be made and cannot be tested beforehand.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"technical_contact\">2. Qualified Technical Customer Contact</h3>\n<p>\n  A qualified technical contact from the customer's side is necessary. This person should:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Be able to administer their Identity Provider (if there is an IdP).</li>\n  <li>While this can be addressed during the implementation process, it remains an important requirement for smooth integration.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"important_considerations\">Important Considerations</h2>\n<p>\n  It is crucial to adhere to the outlined requirements to ensure successful implementation and customer satisfaction. Failure to do so may result in:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Serious complications during the integration process.</li>\n  <li>Customer dissatisfaction with the service.</li>\n  <li>Potential disruptions in service functionality.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  By following these guidelines, we maintain our commitment to quality and service excellence.\n</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863\">FAQ</h1>\n\n<h3 id=\"faq_what_is_tivian_access\">What is TIVIAN Access?</h3>\n<p>TIVIAN Access is an optional add-on module that can be integrated into our software package to enhance its functionality.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"faq_how_to_order\">How do I order TIVIAN Access?</h3>\n<p>You can order TIVIAN Access by visiting https://ww2.umfragecenter.de/uc/order_survey/ and navigating to modules &gt; TIVIAN SSO.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"faq_test_user_importance\">Why is a test user so important?</h3>\n<p>A test user is crucial for testing any changes or updates to the system without disrupting the live environment. It helps prevent service interruptions and ensures smooth functionality.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"faq_technical_contact\">What if we don't have a qualified technical contact?</h3>\n<p>While it's possible to address this during the implementation process, having a qualified technical contact who can administer your Identity Provider is important for a smooth integration. We recommend identifying or training a suitable person for this role.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <strong>Tags: </strong>TIVIAN Access, SSO, Implementation Requirements, Test User, Technical Contact\n</p>\n</article>",
