It's recommended to avoid sending invitations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Before lunch on Mondays</li>\n<li>After lunch on Fridays</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monday mornings risk the invitation being lost in a full inbox, while Friday afternoons may result in the invitation being overlooked until the following week.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"avoid_deadlines\">Avoid using deadlines</h2>\n<p>Using deadlines for surveys is not recommended because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It increases the risk of emails being put into a waiting list</li>\n<li>Other tasks may be prioritized over answering the survey</li>\n<li>Recipients might forget about the survey as the deadline approaches</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead, request an answer as soon as possible to encourage prompt responses.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"reminders\">Reminders as a new opportunity to answer</h2>\n<p>When sending reminders:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a friendly tone</li>\n<li>Present the reminder as a new opportunity to answer</li>\n<li>Convey that the answer is still highly appreciated</li>\n<li>Avoid using the word \"reminder,\" as it may have negative associations</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"internal_vs_external\">Survey reminders for internal vs. external relationships</h2>\n<p>The number of reminders should differ based on the survey's target audience:</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3CSF5GTAB2A50P2RE8DD2BD\">External surveys (e.g., customer surveys)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Send a maximum of one reminder</li>\n<li>More reminders may be perceived as pushy and potentially damage relationships</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3CSF5GTFA015SP1PVRG8V9Q\">Internal surveys (e.g., employee satisfaction surveys)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You can send up to two reminders</li>\n<li>Additional reminders beyond two have minimal effect on the total response rate</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"reminder_timing\">Don't wait too long to send out reminders</h2>\n<p>Based on experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More than half of the responses typically come in on the day the invitation is sent</li>\n<li>Response rates drop significantly each day after the initial invitation</li>\n<li>Send reminders within 3-5 days of the main distribution for best results</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863\">FAQ</h1>\n<h3 id=\"faq_1\">Why should I avoid using deadlines in my survey invitations?</h3>\n<p>Deadlines can lead to procrastination and forgotten surveys. Recipients may put the survey aside, intending to complete it closer to the deadline, but then forget about it entirely. Requesting a response as soon as possible encourages more immediate action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"faq_2\">How many reminders should I send for an external survey?</h3>\n<p>For external surveys, such as those directed at customers, it's best to send only one reminder. Multiple reminders can be perceived as pushy and may potentially harm your relationship with the respondents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"faq_3\">What's the best time frame for sending reminders after the initial survey invitation?</h3>\n<p>It's recommended to send reminders within 3-5 days of the main distribution. This timing capitalizes on the initial interest while ensuring the survey doesn't get forgotten amidst other priorities.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</article>",
