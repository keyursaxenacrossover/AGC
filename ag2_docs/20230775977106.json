The number of survey routes = the number of quotas. Within the survey, you can then work with filters that check for the relevant quota. The fact that the quotas have to be filled successively ensures equal distribution. By definition, random distribution no longer applies; however, this can occur due to the different access times of respondents, which is not something that can be influenced. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863\">FAQ</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRT6KGQX4TNQJX8YDWQ\">Does this method ensure perfect random distribution?</h3>\n<p>While this method ensures equal distribution, it does not guarantee perfect random distribution. The order in which respondents access the survey can introduce some variation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRT7BXQZ7QNWJP2YDKR\">Where can I find more information about quotas?</h3>\n<p>For more detailed information about setting up and using quotas, please refer to the <a href=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20370232914194-Quotas\">Quotas documentation.</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n</article>",
