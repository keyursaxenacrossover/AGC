It covvariouse of question formats, from simple text inputs to complex matrix questions and advanced custom types.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK\">Information</h1>\n<p>EFS Survey offers a diverse set of question types to cater to different survey needs. This guide explains each type, its use cases, and configuration options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#recently-used\">Recently used</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#text-and-multimedia\">Text and multimedia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#single-response\">Single response</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiple-response-list\">Multiple response list</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#fields-for-text-input\">Fields for text input</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#matrix-questions\">Matrix questions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#sliders\">Sliders</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#ranking-rating\">Ranking - Rating</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#advanced\">Advanced</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"recently-used\">Recently used</h2>\n<h3 id=\"recently-used-question-types\">Recently used question types</h3>\n<p>The new question type dialog provides a \"recently used\" view, which contains up to ten last-used question types per user. Since most surveys use only a small subset of our question types, this speeds up the creation of a survey, by showing all recently used question types from different categories in a single view.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"text-and-multimedia\">Text and multimedia</h2>\n<h3 id=\"text-and-image\"><strong>Text and image</strong></h3>\n<p>The “Text and image” question type (998) allows you to freely enter text, images, and, if necessary, HTML code. It is primarily used for inserting and layouting information texts. For the creation of questions, on the other hand, the “Text and image” question type is not suitable, as no variables are available.</p>\n<h4 id=\"entry-dialog\"><strong>Entry Dialog</strong></h4>\n<p>You can use the TinyMCE editor for layout texts. From HTML emails and various panel functionalities, you may already be familiar with the TinyMCE editor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>TinyMCE is a modern WYSIWYG editor. WYSIWYG = what you see is what you get.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If necessary, <strong>Edit HTML source</strong> provides direct access to the source code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you do not want to use the TinyMCE editor, you can easily deactivate the feature in the menu <strong>Options → Personal preferences</strong> on the tab <strong>Behavior of questionnaire editor</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"insert-code-automatically\"><strong>Insert code automatically</strong></h4>\n<p>You can have HTML code inserted automatically for frequently used functions.

First, it always tries to provide a native HTML5 player. This player requires videos in certain container formats (e.g. MP4). See here: <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp\">https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp</a></p>\n<p>These container formats contain video tracks or soundtracks in certain formats (e.g. AVC for video and AAC for audio).</p>\n<p>These formats should have been created with default settings (the so-called profile at a certain level). This is important if you want to have the highest possible support on different devices (e.g. Baseline@3.1). For example, some profiles work in desktop browsers but not on mobile devices, especially older ones, but are still widely used. See here: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding#Profiles\" data-card-appearance=\"inline\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding#Profiles</a></p>\n<p>If the format does not support HTML5, EFS tries to deliver a proprietary Flash player to play the video. Please note that support for all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Edge) has been discontinued and you may have to activate Flash manually (if at all possible). Adobe will also discontinue support for Flash 2020.</p>\n<p>As a last option, EFS provides the format for download. This is exactly what happens here, for example in Chrome. Firefox for example still asks if Fash should be activated.</p>\n<p>In summary, you can say that videos in container format MOV should not be used if you want to cover as many browsers and devices as possible. Recommended here is the container format MP4 with AVC/AAC (Video/Audio) in Baseline@3.1 (Profil/Level).</p>\n<h4 id=\"providing-videos-for-mobile-devices\">Providing videos for mobile devices</h4>\n<p>You can provide these videos in different resolutions/qualities depending on which mobile device they will be used (e.g. on a 4K device that can process and display very high resolutions/quality settings or on a smartphone that can process/display rather lower resolutions/quality settings and is also limited by the bandwidth of mobile networks. The higher the resolution/quality of the video, the more data has to be transferred).</p>\n<p>If the video cannot be played on the device, a download will be provided via HTML5.</p>\n<h3 id=\"audio-player\">Audio Player</h3>\n<p>A dedicated audio player is available. When creating new questions, the audio player can be found in the category “Text and multimedia”.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The audio player supports mp3 with mp3 extension.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The maximum file size corresponds to the installation-specific maximum permitted size of files in the media library.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A dedicated variable allows to track if the audio file has been played completely, partially, or not at all. The variable is created automatically. Per default, it is labeled “Audio has finished playing”. The following missings are used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>77 = not seen</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>66 = no JavaScript, cannot tell if played</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>99 = seen, not played</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1 = seen and completely played</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>0 = seen and partially played but not finished or played in repeat mode</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The “Responsive Layout” audio player is realized based on question type 911 with a comparable functional scope</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>During uploads, all files are immediately scanned for malware, before being moved to their final destination within the EFS platform. If malware is found, the file is immediately removed from the temporary storage and the user is notified that the upload was not successful. This approach ensures that at no point malware can be distributed through EFS.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"entry-dialog-2\">Entry Dialog</h4>\n<p>The entry dialog is closely related to the entry dialog of question type 911.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The “Answers” section is generated automatically.

Questions about age, gender, or income, for example, are usually single-response questions. One single variable is sufficient to store the answer. A code is allocated to each answer option, and the code of the selected option will be stored in the variable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"single-response-list-vertical\">Single response list (Vertical)</h3>\n<p>The vertical single-response list is one of the most commonly used question types.

Go to the section <strong>Detail configuration fallback image</strong> for further configurations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic-answer-option\">Dynamic answer option</h3>\n<p>This <strong>Single response</strong> question type is called the <em>Dynamic answer option</em>. This question type will allow you to present a respondent with a single-response list that dynamically updates based on responses given by previous respondents. This question type replies in the presence of a free text answer as part of the single response list. For example, you may have a single-response question that asks a person their favorite brand of chocolate, with available answers: Cadbury, Lindt, Galaxy, Toblerone, and Other. Against the other, you have included a free text field (<em>Answer option + text</em>).</p>\n<p>The new <em>Dynamic Answer Option</em> type can be configured so that if a specified number of respondents enter Hershey as their favorite chocolate, this option is dynamically added to the list of possible responses for the next respondent to answer the survey. The following settings control this new question type:</p>\n<p><strong>Threshold</strong> – this setting determines the number of respondents who need to have provided this new answer before it is added to the list of available answers. For example, we might decide that 10 people need to choose Hershey before it is added to the list.</p>\n<p><strong>Max amount of answer options</strong> – this setting limits the number of new options that can be dynamically added to the single-response list.</p>\n<p><strong>Respect case sensitivity</strong> - this setting determines whether the case sensitivity of a word produces a new answer option in each case.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternating rows</strong> – this setting determines whether the newly added options are displayed in the order they were dynamically added to the list, or in a more randomized order.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multiple-response-list\">Multiple response list</h2>\n<p>Questions that allow more than one answer are called questions with multiple response lists. In this case, one variable is created for each selection. To store the answer, a dedicated variable is created for each answer option. Depending on the answer, this variable can have two possible states: 0 = not quoted, 1 = quoted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multiple-response-list-vertical\">Multiple response list (Vertical)</h3>\n<p>This question type can be used to ask questions to which there are several possible correct answers.

In a question with ten answer options, for example, you may want the participants to select at most three or between three and five answer options. The respective checks can be realized with combination checks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Participants will frequently check an option “No answer” or “None“, but activate one or several other answers as well. This can easily be prevented by deploying the so-called “exclusive checkbox”.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"fields-for-text-input\">Fields for text input</h2>\n<h3 id=\"text-field-single-row\">Text Field (Single Row)</h3>\n<p>This question type can be used to ask questions to which the answer is to be entered into an open-ended text field.

However several functions were not implemented because they are not suitable for a question type with such a clear-cut purpose.</p>\n<p>The section “Detail configuration” is almost identical to the analog section of the “Linked slider”. It contains the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Maximum value: The desired maximum value.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Force maximum value: The sum of all values has to equal the maximum value.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Error message if the maximum value is not reached: Default: “Please total the choices to %s.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sum caption: Caption in the sum row.

Technically, the new question type is based on the vertical multi text field (143). On desktop PCs, a calendar is displayed. On mobile devices, the date picker is displayed with native elements (see below). If JavaScript is not activated on the participant’s device, a simple text field is used as a fallback.</p>\n<h4 id=\"base-elements-11\">Base Elements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Question text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fill-in instruction</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Help text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Calendar icon</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"entry-dialog-5\">Entry dialog</h4>\n<p>The entry dialog is closely related to the entry dialog of question type 143.

The suggestions are shown in the list of drop-down boxes in alphabetical order. They can also be called up by clicking on the drop-down arrow.</p>\n<p>To use this type of question, upload a CSV file with the answer options to the media library. The import file can contain a maximum of 10.000 lines. You can download an example file from the questionnaire editor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"people-selection\">People selection</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you want to give survey respondents a quick and easy way of selecting a person from a list. For instance, if you want employees to choose someone from their organization to give recognition to, like a high-five or a shout-out. In EFS this has always been possible, but required some complex setup and integration. Now, we’ve made it simple, with a brand-new question type!</p>\n<p>This gives survey respondents direct accurate access to other people in the Panel during a survey. Respondents can search for people by first name, last name, and e-mail address.</p>\n<p>In the Options section of this question type, you configure the following settings: Select a panel group to be used as the source group (the panelists that are displayed in the questionnaire view are taken from this group). Enter placeholder text and a value in relation to the list size, i.e. how many panelists are to be displayed via the drop-down list. The maximum value is 100.</p>\n<p>Please note that for panelists to appear in the search results, the options \"Show profile to others\", \"First name\", \"Last name\" and “E-mail address” must be ticked in the panelist administration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"matrix-questions\">Matrix questions</h2>\n<p>Many scenarios require detailed assessments of issues. The space-saving format of so-called matrix questions has proved suitable for these cases.</p>\n<h3 id=\"standard-matrix\"><strong>Standard Matrix</strong></h3>\n<p>Standard Matrix is the classic matrix question.</p>\n<h4 id=\"base-elements-12\">Base Elements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Question text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fill-in instruction</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Help text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scale options 1-m</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dimensions 1-n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optional: Inside titles 1-o</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optional: Dimension with text entry field</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"question-options\">Question Options</h4>\n<p>As with most other question types, normal matrix questions also provide the following question options: “Mark question as protected”, hiding condition at the question level, vertical and horizontal flip, mandatory (DAC), “Number of items visible” and “Alternate colors”. In the section “answer options”, the following options are available: “Answer option + text”, “inside title”, type check, grouping, randomization, dac at the item level, “Always visible” and hiding condition at the item level.</p>\n<p>If “Mandatory (DAC)” is activated for a matrix question of type 311 and comparable matrix types, this function will only check whether an answer has been<br>given to any dimension. If you want all dimensions to be answered, you should use the DAC function on the item level.</p>\n<p>In addition, the following question type-specific question options may be used when designing the matrix:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Repeat scale headers every x rows: In the case of a matrix question with numerous dimensions, the scale can be repeatedly displayed after x rows so that the respondent can still see the scale apportionment while scrolling, for example.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Only for projects with “Responsive layout”: Display on mobile devices: You can optionally use a drop-down list instead of the usual list of radio buttons.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Only in projects with classic system layout: Width of the left column with the question texts (in pixels): This feature allows you to specify the width of the left column.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"layout\">Layout</h4>\n<p>With question type 311, you have the option of modifying the area between the scale and the answer block by inserting an additional template. This allows you to change the distance, for example.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stars-matrix\">Stars Matrix</h3>\n<p>The question type <em>Stars Matrix</em> allows us to easily visualize answer options, by integrating e.g. smileys, thumbs for Yes/No questions, dice, numbers, gender icons, or other visual elements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When creating new questions in projects with “Responsive Layout”, you can find this new question type in the “Image selection” category. The functional scope is similar to the familiar single response list (111).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Depending on the screen width of the device used, the star rating scale will be displayed horizontally or vertically. Optionally vertical alignment can be enforced for all devices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When creating a new question, smileys are integrated automatically.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The rating direction is from left to right.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can resort to other predefined images in the Tivian library (see next chapter) or upload your images to the media library.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Technically, the new question type is based on the familiar standard matrix (311).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"base-elements-13\">Base Elements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Question text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fill-in instruction</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Help text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scale options 1-m</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dimensions 1-n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"entry-dialog-6\">Entry Dialog</h4>\n<p>The entry dialog is closely related to the familiar entry dialog of question type 111. However several special features were not implemented because they are not suitable for a question type with such a clear-cut purpose.</p>\n<h4 id=\"detail-configuration-5\">Detail Configuration</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Show answer texts: Per default, the texts of the answer options are used as Alt text. Optionally they can be displayed below the icons.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Display reset button: If this option is activated, a <strong>Reset</strong> icon will be shown next to the stars.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Icon for active stars / inactive stars: If you want to use other icons, simply click on the default icons. Then, you can select the desired files from the media library.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Icon for the reset button. The selected image is used for the Reset icon.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"other-standard-and-scale-matrices\">Other standard and scale matrices</h4>\n<p><em>The survey</em> provides three further question types which merely differ from question type 311 in their layout. The use of inside titles is not possible with these question types.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Standard matrix 2, question type 312:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The answers appear next to the respective radio buttons.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Display on mobile devices: You can optionally use a drop-down list instead of the usual list of radio buttons.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using these alternatives is especially recommended when a matrix question becomes so long that the respondent has to scroll. That is because, with question types 312, 321, and 322, the text of the scale is displayed with each question and does not disappear from view during scrolling.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When using this question type, please note the following particularity concerning the display of questions with more than 6 scale options. If you set 6 scale options, all options are displayed properly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21015136749714\" alt=\"image-20231004-103445.png\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you set 7 scale options or more, the participant can only display them by hovering over the respective selection field:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21015136751890\" alt=\"image-20231004-103355.png\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Available question options vary slightly from question type 311. Use of “Answer option + text” and inside titles is not possible. Also, some other 311 question options such as, for example, vertical flips are not available for some of these question types as they do not make sense in the changed layout.</p>\n<h3 id=\"semantic-differential\">Semantic Differential</h3>\n<p>A special form of matrix question is the so-called semantic differential.</p>\n<h4 id=\"base-elements-14\">Base Elements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Question text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fill-in instruction</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Help text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optional: Scale options 1-m</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optional: Title left pole / right pole</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Answer options 1-n left pole / right pole</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optional: Inside titles 1-o</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The semantic differential cannot be used as a source or target question for a list.</p>\n<h4 id=\"question-options-1\">Question Options</h4>\n<p>The following specific options are available for designing a semantic differential:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Only in projects with classic system layout: Width of the left column with the question texts (in pixels): This feature allows you to specify the width of the poles.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Only in projects with classic system layout: Width of a scale property (in pixels): The width of the scale characteristics can be changed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Show scale: After you have ticked the checkbox and clicked on <strong>Save</strong>, a scale will be displayed above the radio buttons. As usual with matrix questions, this scale is edited in the “Scale” section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Title left / right pole: This feature allows you to insert headers above the answer options.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With question type 340, you have the option of modifying the area between the question and the answer block by inserting an additional template, e.g. to change the distance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"drop-down-matrix\">Drop-down matrix</h3>\n<p>This question type can be used to ask questions for which different time states (e.g. for certain university years) or different factual aspects (e.g. geographical limits, such as continents) are given. The time-based or factual differentiation is reflected in the column. The question itself is documented in the row. The following is an example from a survey conducted to assess lectures.</p>\n<p>There are two question types which allow you to create a drop-down matrix:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The figure above shows a normal drop-down matrix (question type 361).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternatively, you can create a vertical drop-down matrix (question type 364), i.e. a mirrored version of question type 361.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"base-elements-15\">Base Elements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Question text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fill-in instruction</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Help text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Columns 1-m</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scale options 1-n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dimensions 1-o</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the closed drop-down lists, you should set up one scale option with the text “Please select” for each of the two answer scales and assign code “0” to it. During evaluation, this will help you to track whether or not a participant has answered the question.</p>\n<p>The Mandatory and DAC functions only work with question types 361 and 364, if a “Please select” scale option with code “0” exists. Under this condition, the DAC function allows you to force respondents to answer an individual dimension. A completeness check for an individual item is not possible with this question type.</p>\n<h3 id=\"checkbox-matrix\">Checkbox matrix</h3>\n<p>Using a checkbox matrix allows you to query facts, for which differing temporal states (e.g. before, during, following a course of study) or different factual aspects (e.g. delineated geographically, such as continents) are required. The temporal or factual differentiation is reflected in the column. The question itself is documented in the row. Below is an example from a survey in which the subsequent career of university graduates is polled.</p>\n<h4 id=\"base-elements-16\">Base Elements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Question text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fill-in instruction</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Help text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Columns 1-n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dimensions 1-m</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is no cell-specific information. There is no description text for the checkboxes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"entry-dialog-7\">Entry Dialog</h4>\n<p>The checkbox matrix entry dialog is largely similar to the entry dialog for a standard scale matrix. Only the section “Scale” differs slightly: the columns are created in this section. Furthermore, you can tag the columns of the checkbox matrix as „exclusive“.</p>\n<h3 id=\"text-field-matrix\">Text field matrix</h3>\n<p>This complex question type allows you to collect a variety of information. This question type is a combination of rows and columns, thus forming a matrix. The information stored in the cells of this matrix is collected using text fields. This question type is therefore called a “text field matrix”.</p>\n<h4 id=\"base-elements-17\">Base Elements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Question text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fill-in instruction</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Help text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Columns 1-n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dimensions 1-m</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cell text for each cell, i.e., with m rows and n columns, m x n cells. Each cell contains text which can be placed before the text field and text which can be placed after the text field.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"entry-dialog-8\">Entry Dialog</h4>\n<p>There are some special features in the text field matrix entry dialog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In the “Scale” section the columns are created as explained for the checkbox matrix in the preceding Chapter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the “Answers” section you can specify the maximum length of the entry for each text field. Default in “Responsive layout” projects: 255 characters. A maximum of 255 characters is permitted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In projects with classic layout, the display width can be specified as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you wish to specify text around the entry field click the<strong> Edit cell text</strong> link. Using the “%s” wildcard you can also specify as with other text field questions where the entry field is to appear.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"accordion-matrix\">Accordion matrix</h3>\n<p>This question type allows a more accessible display of matrix questions on mobile devices. In addition to making the question more accessible on mobile devices, the nature of the layout of this question type reduces the likelihood of people straight-lining their answers. Along with the settings known for a matrix question type, you will find further settings in the detailed configuration that control the structure of the question in the questionnaire view. The information icon informs you in detail about the various options.</p>\n<h3 id=\"carousel\">Carousel</h3>\n<p>The carousel question type is one that has been requested by many customers so we are delighted to include this new question type with Responsive Layout 3.1. This question type provides a more intuitive and simple way for a respondent to provide answers to a long list of questions. Rather than presenting a long list of questions, each question is shown individually to the respondent and the survey automatically switches to the next question upon completion of the current question. This question type supports both left-to-right and right-to-left languages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hotspot-1\">Hotspot</h3>\n<p>The hotspot question type enables you to place answer options onto particular areas of a selected picture. Before uploading your picture, note that you should start by defining the necessary dimensions and scales.</p>\n<p><strong>Elements</strong></p>\n<p>This question type has the following content elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Question text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fill-in instruction</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Help text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scale options 1-n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Answer options 1-n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note: When making a matrix question (type 311 or comparable) mandatory (DAC), the check only validates a question of one random dimension. If you wish to have all dimensions answered as a prerequisite please activate DAC on the item level.</p>\n<p><strong>Detail configuration for Matrix question types</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Exclusive mode for areas: Only one area can be rated. If other areas have been previously rated, they will be reset.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Show answer texts as a tooltip: The respective answer text will be displayed as a tooltip when hovering over it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Initial state for areas: States how areas are displayed initially and whether a button to display unrated areas should be included.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Color for unselected areas: States the color for areas that have not yet been rated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Label the button for displaying areas Defines the button for displaying areas.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Text of the default value in the selected box: Defines the text of the default value in the selected box.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Label of button for closing the dialog Defines the button which closes the dialog.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Image: Upload images, or change and delete previously uploaded images.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that when deleting an image all shapes created will be deleted, too!

As with most other <em>EFS</em> question types, the slider’s code “0” is a system missing value reserved for seen but not answered questions. Therefore, the creation of an answer option encoded “0” is not possible.</p>\n<p>To bypass this issue, create an answer option that may have any code unequal “0” (e.g. code = “101” in a scale from “0” to “100”) and the number “1”, but is labeled “0”.</p>\n<p>Please mind that if you use such a scale, the display of the scale values in a box on the right hand must be deactivated: The box contains the code, which might cause misunderstandings in this special case.</p>\n<h3 id=\"linked-slider\">Linked slider</h3>\n<p>The “Linked Slider” question type is designed for constant sum questions. But instead of asking participants to enter values, the values are visualized using sliders. Therefore, this type is easier to handle and it results in more detailed answers.</p>\n<p>Technically, the “Linked Slider” is based on the vertical multi text field (143). If it cannot be output in a reasonable manner, the “Constant sum” question type serves as a fallback. Currently, the slider can be output in an optimal way on tablet and desktop.

The file name contains the participant’s consecutive number (lfdn) and the file name used by the participant.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Access to this menu is protected by the new right “report_onlinefiles”. It is initially assigned to all user teams that have rights to “report_onlinerep”.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The following file types can be uploaded: doc, docx, ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx, pdf, txt, rtf, png, gif, jpg, jpeg, WMV, avi, MOV, flv, mpg, mpg4, mp4, m4v, mp3, ogg, zip, tgz, bz2, rar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maximum file size: 64 MB</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>During uploads, files are immediately scanned for malware, before being moved to their final destination within the EFS platform. If malware is found, files are immediately removed from the temporary storage, and the user is notified that the upload was not successful. This approach ensures that at no point malware can be distributed through EFS.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note: While Tivian will perform a malware check on all files uploaded using the file upload question type, it is our customers’ responsibility to ensure that any files downloaded are checked by their file security guidelines and requirements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-lua-question-type\">The Lua Question Type</h3>\n<p>The <em>LUA question type</em> enhances the recoding ability of EFS and supports LUA language version 5.1 with default functions. Simple tasks are possible, such as the recoding of survey variables or free formatting of date specifications.</p>\n<p>Please note that extensive knowledge of the LUA language is a prerequisite for working with this question type.</p>\n<p>LUA question type supports LUA language and runs on a sandbox with EFS-specific functionalities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Access to any survey variable via the sandbox, e. g. _G[\"md_0001\"]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>setVariableValue</strong>(varName, varValue): Writes varValue into the variable. Any variables in the survey, including the question type‘s variables can be written into. Example: set variable value('v_1',1)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>setQuestionOutput</strong>(text): Instead of using print, you should use setQuestionOut- put, which prints text in the proper HTML container in the questionnaire. Subse- quent request will replace <em>text</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>getQuotaIds</strong>(): Returns a list of all quota IDs in the survey.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>getQuotaDebitValue</strong>(quotaId): Returns the target value for the quota ID.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>getQuotaCurrentValue</strong>(quotaId): Returns the current quota count for quota ID.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>getQuotaFillingDegree</strong>(quotaId): Returns the filling degree as a float for quota ID.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that LUA functions <strong>file, load, load file, require, rawequal, rawget, </strong>and <strong>rawset </strong>cannot be executed from the sandbox for security reasons. Instead of <strong>print </strong>use <strong>setQuestionOutput(text) </strong>to set (text) as a result.</p>\n<p>The LUA question type comes with two code boxes, the first one is executed before sending the page to the participant, and the second code box is executed when a user submits the page containing the LUA question type.</p>\n<p>You can include your function libraries from the media library (global or project-specific, text files with the extension .txt or .lua). Hiding conditions can be employed and you may define whether the script should be executed every time the page is called or only once (e.g. when using a page trigger or the back button).</p>\n<p>Find the LUA question type in the questionnaire editor in the <strong>Advanced </strong>section.</p>\n<h3 id=\"audio-recorder\">Audio recorder</h3>\n<p>The <em>Audio recorder</em> question type allows participants the record audio feedback through a simple-to-use UI on desktops and mobile devices. The recordings are stored in the same way as for the <em>Upload </em>question type and can be accessed through the <strong>Statistics</strong> menu. The maximum file size for this question type is 32 MB. By clicking on <strong>Start recording</strong> participants can start the recording of their audio feedback, and the <strong>Stop</strong> symbol will end it. Afterwards, participants can play their recording, or delete it and start another one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21015166791186\" alt=\"image-20231027-071520.png\"><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21015166789138\" alt=\"image-20231027-071558.png\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Find the <em>Audio recorder</em> question type in the questionnaire editor in the <strong>Advanced </strong>section.</p>\n<h3 id=\"video-recorder\">Video recorder</h3>\n<p>With the <em>Video recorder</em> question type, your participants can record and upload a video as an answer to a question.
