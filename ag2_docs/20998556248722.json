This page module has been optimized for usage in small layout columns.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998582442514\" alt=\"c06b384f-6ba6-462d-8178-3e42522c9931\"></p>\n<p><strong>Downloaded reports are highlighted</strong></p>\n<p>To see all downloaded reports at a glance, they are now highlighted with a background color.</p>\n<p><strong>New archive data structure for download of several reports</strong></p>\n<p>When downloading several reports at the same time, the reports are now delivered as a single ZIP archive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"header-5\">Portals CMS</h3>\n<p><strong>Group filter, assignment of several roles, changing roles as mass processing</strong></p>\n<p>You are now able to group Portals users by filter setting. Furthermore, you can assign several roles to a user simultaneously as well as change roles of Portals users simultaneously for several users via mass processing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"header-6\">Circles</h3>\n<p>With Circles, Portals users can create their own contact lists from the participants of a portal and manage them (Personal Circles). Also, they can access circles generated for them (Managed Circles).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998625382162\" alt=\"88b6d222-0e57-44a5-ba75-0b7008d3e57a\"><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998608665618\" alt=\"9142da31-3850-4a95-85d0-3bb0fce11516\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"header-7\">On-Demand Guided – Integration of Circles</h3>\n<p>When creating a new survey in the page module On-Demand Guided, Portals users are now able to select contacts from their circles they want to invite to their survey.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998578089746\" alt=\"610466b2-00ee-469d-ae5f-c5dc5dd62ef0\"><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998581681042\" alt=\"e174d148-f7f4-47e5-8298-9e7c40d0a69a\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"header-8\">Portal Switch</h3>\n<p>With Portal Switch, Portals users are now able to switch from one portal to another without having to login again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"header-10\">Closed Loop Feedback and Action Planner enhancements</h2>\n<h3 id=\"header-12\">New add-on module CLF</h3>\n<p>To implement Closed Loop Feedback in EFS even more effectively and to optimize the whole workflow of your project, the add-on module CLF is now available. With this module, you have additional functions at your disposal supporting a smooth performance of your CLF-project and therefore accelerating the whole process effectively.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in the add-on module CLF, please contact us.</p>\n<h3 id=\"header-13\">Activating add-on module CLF</h3>\n<p>After the enablement of your add-on module CLF, you can activate it by checking the boxes Activate Action Planner and Activate CLF in a new ES project in the Org Processor settings. Hereby the features Workflows and CLF configuration overview are being enabled among others.</p>\n<h3 id=\"header-14\">CLF configuration overview</h3>\n<p>In your project under Org Processor &gt; Configuration &gt; CLF configuration overview, the add-on module CLF provides you with the CLF configuration overview which will guide you through the configuration process of CLF related applications in the context of preparing the Action Planner. This EFS page gives you an overview of required and optional settings. The fields are highlighted in color to show the status of each setting: blue fields indicate settings in your ES project which already have been configured, red fields indicate settings (still) not set. All settings required should be highlighted in blue at the end of the configuration process. Via links from the CLF configuration overview, you reach the relevant pages in the admin area on which you can set the respective settings directly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"header-15\">Creating and configuring org structures, users and roles</h3>\n<p>When creating and configuring additional roles for Org users, you have new access rights in the Rights administration under section Follow Up – Action Planner at your disposal. Those rights apply to adding new comments to tasks and editing or deleting own comments (actionplanner_comment_create), editing or deleting all comments in relation to tasks (actionplanner_comment_moderate), the general visibility and use of Workflows (actionplanner_workflow_use) as well as accessing survey results (actionplanner_view_survey_result).</p>\n<p>Adding Org-Processor users to the org structure can be done in two different ways: either by using the Org Processor and synchronizing users to People (see 17.1 feature) or by using People and synchronizing panel groups to your ES project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"header-16\">Sync from People to Employee org structure</h3>\n<p>In addition to synchronizing Org users to People, you are now able to synchronize panel groups to the org structure of your ES project, under:</p>\n<p>People &gt; Groups &gt; [select group] &gt; Employee-Sync &gt; Add Employee-Sync Job</p>\n<p>Here, the following information is required: select your ES project as well as the master- data variable storing the respective assignment of panelists to their roles and unit. Roles and units are quoted in the following format: [ROLE ABBREVIATION]:[metaname(s) of org unit(s)]. Different roles are separated by semicolon, different units by commas. Example: OWN:unit1; SUP:unit2, unit3, unit4.</p>\n<p>The synchronization for each ES project runs once a day. For a successful synchronization, the panelists of the group need a master-data variable with at least one role and unit assignment.</p>\n<p>During the synchronization, all existing roles and units are being deleted and then created again. Correct roles and units are being transferred, incomplete roles and units remain deleted.</p>\n<p>On errors, an e-mail is sent to the job creator. The error of the last synchronization can be viewed by going to People &gt; Groups &gt; [select group] &gt; Employee-Sync as well as by editing a job. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998593645202\" alt=\"272a83e2-2a80-4242-a3f2-682df53e97b7\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"header-17\">Workflows</h3>\n<p>Main feature of the add-on module CLF are the workflow buttons which enable you to assign, escalate, close and reopen tasks as well as invite participants to follow-up surveys. Workflows allow quick actions without the need to edit a task. For smooth interaction, most actions allow commenting from a modal dialog.</p>\n<p><strong>Configure Workflows</strong></p>\n<p>Workflows are here: Org Processor &gt; Configuration &gt; Action Planner configuration &gt; Workflow. For each of the three status – Not started, Started, Completed – actions can be added. Linked actions are configurable, the order of workflows can be adapted via drag and drop. Some workflows require mail templates – by using #action_comment# in the mail template, comments in relation to tasks can be included in e-mails.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998593409554\" alt=\"e9952506-2754-47e4-8afc-3cb987e419ba\"></p>\n<p>All workflows move the status from Not started to Started when triggered.</p>\n<p><strong>Assign to</strong></p>\n<p>This workflow allows the assignment of tasks to users of one’s own unit only or to users of one’s own unit and all levels down.</p>\n<p><strong>Assign to me</strong></p>\n<p>This workflow allows the assignment of tasks to the current user.</p>\n<p><strong>Escalate to</strong></p>\n<p>This workflow allows the escalation of tasks to users of the next level up. Escalated tasks are viewable through the Portals page module Task List with the filter setting Show escalated tasks, regardless of role rights in the org structure. Also, commenting on the escalated tasks is still available.</p>\n<p><strong>Invite to follow-up survey</strong></p>\n<p>This workflow allows the invitation of survey participants to follow-up surveys. This workflow requires a mail template for e-mail transmission, a PE survey for the follow up, the variables for storing the task ID and the ES project PID as well as the ac variables (Action Planner variables) containing the participant’s e-mail address and the PID of the follow-up survey.</p>\n<p><strong>Close</strong></p>\n<p>This workflow allows the closing of tasks by users responsible for the respective task. Furthermore, automatic invitations to follow-up surveys can be triggered.</p>\n<p><strong>Reopen</strong></p>\n<p>This workflow allows the reopening of previously closed tasks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"header-18\">Reminders and Auto-Escalations</h3>\n<p>The existing reminder functionality in the Action Planner has been extended with an auto-escalation feature: Besides triggering e-mails, expired tasks can now be moved one level up to a superior unit. Escalated tasks are still viewable for the origin unit through filter setting. The completion date can be extended upon escalation to avoid further automatic escalation before the next user was able to edit mentioned task.</p>\n<h3 id=\"header-19\">New display types in Action Planner</h3>\n<p>There are two new display types in the Action Planner: image and hyperlink. With image, links can be embedded as an image, hyperlink is interpreted as a link to another page. These display types can be adapted in the Portals page module Task List and have no influence on the exterior view of the Org Processor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"header-20\">Subject groups</h3>\n<p>In addition to the export of subject groups, it is now also possible to import subject groups.</p>\n<h3 id=\"header-21\">Extended completion date</h3>\n<p>The completion date (ac_date) is now a full timestamp with date and time, e.g. 2017- 06-20 10:00:01. – This format is now also expected when importing tasks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"header-22\">Task List in Portals</h3>\n<p>The Action Planner module MyTasks from 17.1 is renamed as Task List.</p>\n<p><strong>Filter</strong></p>\n<p>With Task List, Portals users can filter and search tasks. Toggles provide additional filters for showing only current user’s tasks or only escalated tasks of one’s own unit.</p>\n<p><strong>Survey link</strong></p>\n<p>In detailed view, when using the Task Trigger (formerly named Action Trigger), the single survey participation is available by clicking the form icon. A popup will display the results of the survey participation using the html print preview.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998564244626\" alt=\"d18cb65d-20de-4b5d-b469-88730f218137\"></p>\n<p><strong>Tagging of tasks</strong></p>\n<p>The tagging of single tasks is now available in edit view. This can be used to quickly add categorization or solution design.</p>\n<p>Tags currently cannot be exported or used in MySight.</p>\n<p><strong>Portals translation module</strong></p>\n<p>With the translation module in Portals, most strings in the Task List page module, including Workflow labels, can be replaced or translated.</p>\n<p><strong>Notification settings</strong></p>\n<p>Portals users can control what types of notifications they will receive from the Task List page module. Push notifications require the portals app on the mobile device to be installed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998623870482\" alt=\"c54d6bf1-f169-44a9-b2de-717931ae20b7\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"header-23\">Service Layer: Import of data and use of Triggers</h3>\n<p>The new data import function (survey.participants.importParticipantAndSurveyResultFromCSV) imports data to PE and ES projects. It also executes Mail Triggers, Recoding Triggers and Task Triggers on the default final page of the questionnaire.</p>\n<h1 id=\"header-25\">MySight</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J6CVZ3PS99J8JG96E4NT169W\">Recoding of text variables</h3>\n<p>With the new recoding functionality, text strings can be formatted as data types integer (digit), float (decimal number), datetime (date and time) or recoded to a question with up to 100 answer options. The recoding of the data type datetime additionally needs the source format in which date and time are stored in the variable. Information on formatting is available at <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php\" data-card-appearance=\"inline\">http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php</a> .</p>\n<p>When choosing the option “Format fact as integer/float/datetime”, the text will get formatted with the selected date type. The formatted value will be found in the correspondent column INT_VALUE/ FLOAT_VALUE/ DATE_VALUE.</p>\n<p>When choosing the option “Convert to dimension as integer/float/datetime”, however, a new column is created in the fact table displaying the relevant data type.</p>\n<p>When choosing the option “Recode value to answer option”, any text can be recoded to a single response question. The following points should be considered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The number of recoded values is limited to 100. In exceptional cases, our support team may extend this value. Any participation creating answer options beyond this limit will receive the ID ‘NOT ANSWERED’.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Recoding is case insensitive. – Should the answer option ‘Example’ already exist, for ‘example’ with lower-case letter no new answer option will be created, but the ID of ‘Example’ will be used. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998592812306\" alt=\"96206f56-58c0-45d0-b825-bfa6233e4e3f\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"header-26\">EFS Platform</h1>\n<h3 id=\"header-28\">New REST API adapter</h3>\n<p>Besides the legacy adapters SOAP, PHP-RPC and JSON-RPC, you have now also the possibility to access the API with REST. The new REST API is addressed by URLs that contain more than three path-elements, e.g.https://example.questback.com/service/survey/surveys/.</p>\n<p>As with other service layer adapters, individual services need to be activated for the user or group to be used by that user or group.</p>",
