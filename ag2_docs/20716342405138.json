The contract with Okta will start on January 2020. The production account for Okta will be available on January 2020.</p><p></p><p><strong><u>Focused Client Group:</u></strong></p><p>Clients are focused that meet the following criteria:</p><ul>\n<li><p>Clients having their own IdP</p></li>\n<li><p>Clients having managed (IdP) users in Portals</p></li>\n<li><p>Clients using EFS Admin and Portals only</p></li>\n</ul><p></p><p><strong><u>Requirements for Clients:</u></strong></p><p>The focused group of clients have to match some requirements to enable IAM.</p><ul>\n<li><p>The IdP can be accessed from outside/the internet (like Okta, Auth0, Azure AD)</p></li>\n<li><p>The IdP can be federated based on SAML 2 or OpenID Connect</p></li>\n<li><p><del>The clients do only have managed users  in Portals</del></p></li>\n<li><p>The client has to have the newest version of EFS (19.5)</p></li>\n<li><p>The IdP offers users based on email-addresses and will provide first and last name of the users</p></li>\n<li><p>Customization has to be adaptable to the new module</p></li>\n<li><p>The installations have to use HTTPS and not http (Added on 16.01.2020)</p></li>\n</ul><p></p><p><strong><u>Impact on other features when activating IAM module: </u></strong></p><ul>\n<li><p>Changing the email-address is not possible without a time consuming request to our support and manual processes</p></li>\n<li><p>Password changes will be handled in Okta</p></li>\n<li><p><del>Inviting external people to Portals is not possible anymore</del></p></li>\n<li><p>Authorization is still handled in the respective application - EFS or Portals (only authentication will be handled by the current IAM solution)</p></li>\n<li><p>Importing big numbers of user might take additional time in case IAM is active due to user also being synchronized with Okta. This occurs due to a rate limit in Okta APIs. In case IAM is active it might make sense to decrease the import limit and increase it in case admin know the consequences.</p></li>\n</ul><p></p><p><strong><u>Decisions on specific features:</u></strong></p><ul>\n<li><p>Migration: All panelists will be migrated if necessary (see below).</p></li>\n<li><p>Customization: Customization is out of scope for the first phase of the project.</p></li>\n<li><p>Panelists can be excluded from SSO entirely (see below). <ac:emoticon ac:emoji-fallback=\":question_mark:\" ac:emoji-id=\"atlassian-question_mark\" ac:emoji-shortname=\":question_mark:\" ac:name=\"question\"></ac:emoticon></p></li>\n</ul><p></p><p></p><p><strong><u>also see </u></strong><ac:link ac:card-appearance=\"inline\"><ri:page ri:content-title=\"MVP\" ri:version-at-save=\"11\"></ri:page><ac:link-body>MVP</ac:link-body></ac:link><strong><u> </u></strong></p><p></p><p><strong><u>Impact on pending solutions:</u></strong></p><p><strong>Migration/Imports:</strong></p><p>see <ac:link ac:card-appearance=\"inline\"><ri:page ri:content-title=\"Mass User Sync (Migration)\" ri:version-at-save=\"4\"></ri:page><ac:link-body>Mass User Sync (Migration)</ac:link-body></ac:link> </p><p><del>There is a limit on Okta side regarding user creation. Therefore the first clients should be picked carefully. Clients with a huge number of users are a risky way to learn what our solution is capable of and might cause issues during migration. Take this into consideration before selecting clients.</del></p><p>All EFS Admin users and Panelists will be migrated. This might take some time. But it is scheduled asynchronously and has a natural limit for big migrations. If there is an incident we should ask Okta to raise their API limit for this specific use case.</p><p></p><p><strong><u>New decision from 25.11.2019</u></strong></p><p>There will be a contract with Okta.</p><p></p><p><strong><u>New business decision from 25.11.2019</u></strong></p><p><u>Panelwebsite and SSO for EFS Admin only.</u></p><p>Add a setting to enable clients using Panelwebsite and EFS Admin only to use SSO for EFS Admin only. This setting will prevent user synchronization in the People module. User migration regarding the initial synchronization of users will not be affected as it is a manual process for now.</p><p></p><p></p>",
