    "body": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 2.1em;\">Overview</span></p>\n<article>\n<p>This article discusses the limitations of copy and print protection for surveys hosted on Tivian's platform and provides information on available security measures.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK\">Information</h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Generally speaking, respondents access our survey software using standard Web browsers (Chrome, Mozilla, etc.). Therefore, copy/print protection is not possible, as our software has no access to the terminal device of the user/browser. It is possible, however, to disable use of the right-hand mouse button within the survey. This option is found under “Disable use of the right-hand mouse button in the survey” in the project properties. As a result, the browser’s context menu – with commands such as “Show source text,” “Save image as ...,” etc. – can be deactivated, provided that the test user has activated JavaScript.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863\">FAQ</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRT5KGBE1YQXDS80NQX\">Can I completely prevent users from copying or printing my survey content?</h3>\n<p>No, due to the nature of web-based surveys and the limitations of browser interactions, it's not possible to implement full copy or print protection. However, you can use the right-click disabling feature to add a layer of difficulty for users attempting to copy or save survey content.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRT6KGBE1YQXDS80NQY\">Will disabling the right-click function prevent all copying of survey content?</h3>\n<p>While disabling the right-click function makes it more difficult for users to copy content, it doesn't prevent all methods of copying. Advanced users may still find ways to access the content through other means, such as using keyboard shortcuts or browser developer tools.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</article>",
