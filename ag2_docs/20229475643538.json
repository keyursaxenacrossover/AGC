It covers the creation, viewing, editing, and rights administration of exchange teams, as well as the assignment of user teams to these exchange teams.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Information</h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Exchange Teams in EFS Secure Exchange are used to manage access rights for file exchanges.  First, create exchange teams, configure their rights, and assign user teams to these exchange teams. Ensure all involved persons have EFS accounts and are assigned to user teams. If needed, create user accounts and assign them to appropriate teams. Grant access rights based on the required level of access: for the File exchange menu in the EFS Survey admin area, use the ACL right \"area_www\"; for the separate fm login, use the ACL right \"area_fm\". If access rights vary within a team, create additional user teams and reassign members as necessary.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">This guide explains how to create and manage these teams, assign user teams, and configure appropriate access rights for different scenarios.</p>\n<ul class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">\n<li><a href=\"#viewing_editing_exchange_teams\">Viewing and Editing Exchange Teams</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#creating_new_exchange_team\">Creating a New Exchange Team</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#assigning_teams_rights_admin\">Assigning Teams and Rights Administration</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"viewing_editing_exchange_teams\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Viewing and Editing Exchange Teams</h2>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Exchange teams are managed through the <strong>Users → Exchange teams</strong> menu.

For example, the HR department at \"Real Estate\" needs to prepare for an employee survey. HR project managers should have full editing rights for all files, while other staff should only download files and modify/delete their own.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">To manage rights appropriately, create and assign user teams:</p>\n<ul class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">\n<li>\n<strong>Real Estate project managers</strong>: Unrestricted access.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Real Estate staff</strong>: Limited to downloading and editing their own files.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Assign rights to the exchange team \"Exchange team Real Estate\":</p>\n<ul class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">\n<li>\n<strong>Real Estate project managers</strong>: \"Write\" access.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Real Estate staff</strong>: \"Read\" access</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"> </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">FAQ</h1>\n<h3 id=\"faq_cannot_see_menu\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Why can't I see the Exchange teams menu?</h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">If you cannot see the Exchange teams menu, your account may lack the ACL right \"exchange_teams\".

You can always assign user teams to an exchange team at a later stage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"faq_different_rights\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">How can I give different rights to members of the same user team?</h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">If you need to give different rights to members of the same user team, you may need to create additional user teams and reassign the members accordingly.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"> </p>\n</article>",
