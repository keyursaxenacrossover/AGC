Listed are the title, the author, and the date of the last change.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In order to edit one of the existing reports, click on it and select the appropriate button below the list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Open</strong>: This will open the report. Alternatively, you can also open a report by double-clicking on its title. Please note: A report can only be edited by one user at a time. If you try to open a report that is being edited by another user, this will prompt a message telling you that the report is currently blocked. Now you can either wait or view the report in read-only mode. In read-only mode, the drag-and-drop function and other actions are disabled and all icons, buttons, and settings are greyed out.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: You can change the entries for the title, description, and author in the dialog.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Copy</strong>: A copy of the report will be created.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delete</strong>: The report will be deleted. Please note that any existing export files will also be deleted. Especially if you wish to keep export files of the report available on EFS Survey Status, you should not delete the report.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you wish to create another report, select the <strong>Create Report</strong> button and follow the instructions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">To use <em>EFS Reporting+</em>, you need to write rights to the ACL right <em>report_reporting</em>. Otherwise, you won’t be able to see the <em>EFS Reporting+</em> menu.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creating-a-report\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Creating a report</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">To create a new report, please proceed as follows:</p>\n<ul class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">\n<li>\n<p>All standard texts in the new report, e.g. information on the project or the labeling of the first chapter, will be automatically preset in your admin area language. Therefore, before opening the report manager, please set your <em>EFS</em> admin area to the language in which you want to create the report. (Some of the preset texts cannot be changed at a later date.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click on the <strong>Create Report</strong> button.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter the title.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optionally, you can add a description or name the author of the report.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your report is automatically created in the default survey language shown in the report dialog under <strong>Language</strong>. Optionally, you can import all languages available for your report by selecting <strong>All Languages</strong> from the drop-down list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In personalized surveys, you can optionally select participant or panelist data: These data will then be included in the report and will be available for evaluation. Please note that you will not be able to return to this option later on.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In panel and master data surveys, you can select panel-specific data such as master data or performance data (Chapter 4.3, p. 18). Please note that you will not be able to return to this option later on.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Furthermore, you can select Panelist base data, Panel tracking data, and Panel group data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Confirm by clicking on <strong>Create</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The report will be created. In this process, the current questionnaire structure, the existing result data of the project, and possibly also certain panel-specific data will be included in <em>EFS Reporting+</em>. Upon completion, the report will be opened for further editing.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">You can create up to three reports per project.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">To create your report in another language than the one predefined, change the default survey language under <strong>project information</strong> accordingly, before you create your report.</p>\n<h3 id=\"subsequent-updating-of-reports\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Subsequent updating of reports</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">When you create a report, the current questionnaire structure and the existing result data of the respective project will be transferred into<em> EFS Reporting+</em>. If you have made any subsequent changes to the questionnaire or if additional respondents have participated after creating your report, you can manually update it. This update includes:</p>\n<ul class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">\n<li>\n<p>The latest result data of the project will be included in the report.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All calculations in the report will be repeated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the questionnaire structure has changed in the meantime, the affected structural elements will be marked.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">You will find this function in the <strong>Extras</strong> → <strong>Data update</strong> menu. The update process requires considerable resources. Therefore, <em>EFS</em> checks if an update is required and prevents excessive usage.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">After performing an update, please check your report and adjust any changed parts accordingly. The following figures show typical markings and messages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"updating-automatically\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Updating automatically</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">The update process can be triggered automatically. I.e. if necessary, the data can be updated automatically each night, and in the morning you can work with up-to-date results.</p>\n<ul class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">\n<li>\n<p>You cannot select today as the first day of execution. It can be the following day, at the earliest.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The update is only executed as long as the project is in one of the following statuses: “created”, “survey compiled”, “active”, and “no further participations”. Once the project status has changed to “inactive”, “finished” or “archived”, the update is triggered one last time. Afterward, the rule will be deleted and the automated update deactivated.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">You will find this function in the<strong> Report </strong>→ <strong>Report settings</strong> menu on the General tab. Please proceed as follows:</p>\n<ul class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">\n<li>\n<p>Tick the “Update report data automatically” checkbox.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Specify the first day of execution and the time. It is recommended to use periods when the server traffic is low.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Define the execution interval. You can select x days, weeks, or months.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Confirm with <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Completed report files can be updated as well. This is useful, for example, if you want to offer fresh results for download on<em> EFS Survey Status</em>. Additionally, you will have the choice to save the last ten exports. If this option is checked, the latest export will not be overwritten by a later one.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Just go to the export dialog, select Automatic export update, and configure the update process as explained above.</p>\n<h3 id=\"restricting-access-to-reporting\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">\n<strong>Restricting access to </strong><em><strong>Reporting+</strong></em>\n</h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">The rights system of <em>EFS</em> provides you with the means to control access to both<em> Reporting+</em> and the created reports.</p>\n<ul class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">\n<li>\n<p>Access to <em>Reporting+</em> is protected by the new ACL right <em>report_reporting</em>.

It is not possible to include them at a later date.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can find the data on the <strong>Survey</strong> tab in the <strong>Participant Data</strong> section.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Metanames</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">If data is available from the Org Processor it will be imported when creating the report. This data includes a participant‘s entire set of metaname-variables and will be displayed separately by spaces.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-panel-specific-data\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Using panel-specific data</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">To import panel-specific data or to access them via the<strong> Panel</strong> tab in the source window, you need appropriate ACL rights. Panelist data: read rights to “panelsexport”; master data: read rights to “panelstats”; panel basic data, tracking data, and panel group data: read rights to “panelstatus”. Please note that the ACL rights do not restrict access to the existing report structure or existing filters, recodes, or split dimensions.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">When evaluating panel and master data surveys, you may also use panel-specific data. In general, the following data types are available:</p>\n<ul class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">\n<li>\n<p>Panelist data: participant data of the panelists (u variables)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Master data (m and md variables)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Panel basic data: important system variables (mode of entry, language version, way of entry, PCI value, panelist status in the master data survey, and panel status)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Panel tracking data (track variables)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Panel group data: membership of panelists in panel groups</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">To have these panel-specific data available in the report, you have to include them according to the following instructions when you create your report. It is not possible to include them at a later date.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">It is possible to group imported yes-/no-master data in <em>Reporting+</em>. For this purpose, master data must correspond to the following pattern: md_[group name]_[numerical value]. Master data of the same group name are combined into one group in Reporting+. The groups are displayed in „Sources“ on the tab „Panel“ in the section „Master data grouped“. Corresponding data will be automatically updated to the group when being added.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Including all available panel-specific data in a report can have adverse effects on the performance. However, by carefully selecting the panel data to be included according to the respective objective of your evaluation you can keep the number of variables in your report small, resulting in improved processing times.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Performing an import</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">When creating a report on a panel or master data survey, an additional “Options” section will be displayed in the create dialog. Select the desired data. The following figure shows the imported data in the sources window (in the example, all data were imported).</p>\n<h3 id=\"importing-external-data\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Importing external data</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">If necessary, you can import data collected outside of<em> EFS</em> into <em>EFS Reporting+</em> and subsequently use those data as source data for your evaluation.</p>\n<ul class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">\n<li>\n<p>You will find the import function in the <strong>Extras</strong> → <strong>Import external data</strong> menu. In the following, the import will be explained in detail.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upon completion of the import, the data will be available on the <strong>External</strong> tab of the sources window.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Advice for your planning</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">The following advice will help you in preparing your import:</p>\n<ul class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">\n<li>\n<p>You can import up to 100 additional variables per report. These variables will be created anew. It is not possible to import any values for already existing variables, neither for <em>EFS</em> variables nor for previously imported external data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When importing, you can specify whether the values of the imported variables shall be treated as codes or as text. External variables of the “code” data type may have up to 25 answer options. If you have to import variables with a greater number of answer options, you may alternatively declare those variables as being of the \"text\" data type: The data will then be displayed in the report as open-ended answers. They cannot be used for crossbreaks, calculations, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The usual missing values (“-77”, “-66”, “-99”) can be used in the import file: They will be treated as user-defined missings in the report.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the imported variable names are displayed in the report, the labels can be subsequently adapted via the table editor. It is not possible to subsequently edit the imported values or the data types.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When importing answers to multiple response questions, it may make sense to use the recoding function to combine multiple variables into one question or to display the 0/1 encoding (“selected” / “not selected”) as desired.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If an import file contains two columns with identical labels or if you import the same variable twice, then two new variables will be created. Internally, <em>EFS</em> will assign unique names to all columns of the import file, there will be no duplicates check.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When performing multiple imports, a dedicated, dated file for each import operation will be created on the <strong>External</strong> tab, containing all variables imported within this operation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Creating an import file</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">The import file should be structured as follows:</p>\n<ul class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">\n<li>\n<p>The import file should be in CSV or Excel format.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>One column is used for each variable to be imported.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A column should contain the consecutive numbers of the participants (“lfdn”) so that the imported data records can be linked to the data records in <em>EFS Reporting+</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The first row should contain the labels of the variables.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The following rows contain the external data records of the participants.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Performing an import</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Please proceed as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">\n<p>Please make sure that your report contains all current data records.
