It is important to have a clear definition of what is included in standard support without additional costs. Customers need to be informed that some support tasks will incur additional charges. A grace period may be implemented to avoid any discussions regarding unexpected costs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"billable_services_table\">Billable Services Table</h2>\n<p>The following table outlines various tasks, their classifications, effort estimates, and proposed price tags.
