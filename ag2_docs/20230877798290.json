Please note that multiple or large files may influence the load time of the survey. The total size of embedded files should not exceed 200 MB. Files can be initially uploaded to the media library and then easily added to the survey by copying the link.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863\">FAQ</h1>\n<h3 id=\"faq1\">Can I embed any type of image file in my survey?</h3>\n<p>While EFS Survey supports standard image formats like JPEG, it's best to check the documentation for a complete list of supported image file types.</p>\n<h3 id=\"faq2\">How can I ensure my survey loads quickly with embedded media?</h3>\n<p>To optimize survey load times, use smaller file sizes when possible and avoid embedding too many large files in a single survey.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</article>",
