    "body": "<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRS9JVGC6E9EA3DB98K\">Overview</h1>\n<p>This article provides comprehensive information about disposition codes in survey management. Disposition codes are used to track the status of participants in a survey field, providing valuable insights into the progress and state of your survey at any given time.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK\">Information</h1>\n<p>Every participant in a field has a so-called disposition code which describes their status in the field. This records, for example, whether participants have already been invited and whether they have already begun the survey or completed it. The field statistics, which builds on these statuses, give you extensive information on the status of your field, i.e. your survey, at any time. The disposition codes have two digits. The areas are defined as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>10s: before the survey</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>20s: during the survey</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>30s: after the survey</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The disposition codes are mutually exclusive: Any person can have only one disposition code at any given time. Therefore, the status variable can only assume one of the above characteristics at a time. The majority of disposition codes is assigned automatically and changed depending on the progress of the survey.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" data-layout=\"default\">\n<colgroup>\n<col style=\"width: 159.0px;\">\n<col style=\"width: 169.0px;\">\n<col style=\"width: 432.0px;\">\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th data-highlight-colour=\"#57d9a3\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Disposition code</strong></p>\n</th>\n<th data-highlight-colour=\"#57d9a3\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Status</strong></p>\n</th>\n<th data-highlight-colour=\"#57d9a3\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Comment</strong></p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">10</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Consent seen</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">This status is set when an anonymous survey is started and the consent form is displayed, but the participant does not give consent or reject the consent prompt.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">11</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Not yet invited</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The participant has not yet been invited.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">12</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Invited</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The link has not yet been used.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">13</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Inactive</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Only on EFS Panel installations: If you change the panel status<br>of panelists to “inactive” or “deleted”, their disposition code<br>will be changed to 13 in all samples in which they had disposition code 11 or 12 so far (i.e. they haven’t participated yet).

This helps in managing and analyzing the progress of your survey.</p>\n<h3 id=\"faq_2\">How are disposition codes assigned?</h3>\n<p>Most disposition codes are assigned automatically based on the participant's progress through the survey. Some codes may require manual assignment, especially for cases that cannot be automatically detected by the system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"faq_3\">Can a participant have multiple disposition codes at once?</h3>\n<p>No, disposition codes are mutually exclusive. A participant can only have one disposition code at any given time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"faq_4\">How can I customize disposition codes?</h3>\n<p>Some disposition codes (e.g., 16, 17, 18, 19, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40) are reserved for customization and can be used for further differentiation of participant statuses. Contact your system administrator or support team for assistance with customization.</p>",
