(from a Tech standpoint I (Markus) would recommend against doing that)</p></li>\n<li><p>Will there be a standard application for each tenant in case JIT provisioning should be supported?</p></li>\n</ul><p></p><ul>\n<li><p>What about existing solutions (especially customizings)? Do have to keep up with those solutions? Will we “downgrade” customers?</p></li>\n<li><p>Will JIT be supported? That would need some extra planning</p></li>\n</ul><p></p><ul><li><p>One panelist in multiple tenants → how does this use-case work? If we cannot tell the panelist that we are hosting that software than this panelist will be unique having one password for all installations. We cannot communicate to the user that he has to use the same password for different panels of different companies?!? → this prevents at least a dashboard and also a common realm setup of keycloak and Okta and others → how to handle this?</p></li></ul>",
