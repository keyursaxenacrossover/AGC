In conjunction with Authorization Servers it defines the contract between an application and the Identity Provider. Therefore it is the central piece of enabling applications to use the Identity Provider.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table border=\"1\" data-layout=\"default\">\n<colgroup>\n<col style=\"width: 340.0px;\">\n<col style=\"width: 340.0px;\">\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>\n<p><strong>What</strong></p>\n</th>\n<th>\n<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Sign on method and platform</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Open ID Connect → see <a href=\"https://openid.net/connect/\">https://openid.net/connect/</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-highlight-colour=\"#f4f5f7\">\n<p><strong>General</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p> </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Grant Types</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Client credentials - NOT IN USE</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Implicit flow:</strong><br>This flow is mostly used for Single Page Applications.

In this case only the server has the tokens for a user and manages them. The Refresh Token grant will enable the server to get new tokens if the given ones are invalid but the user still has a valid session.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Login Redirect URI <strong>***</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Okta will redirect a user back to this Login URI after the login process.

In case of portal-specific applications the redirect URI will be configured for each domain-alias registered in EFS (Options / Domains) at creation or edit application. The migration script offers an additional option to update all portal-specific applications to get their redirect links up-to-date.</p>\n<p><strong><u>For API Access see: <a href=\"https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/apps/\">https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/apps/</a></u></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",
