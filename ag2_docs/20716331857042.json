Rather than just asking for a username and password, MFA requires other—additional—credentials, such as a code from the user’s smartphone, the answer to a security question, a fingerprint, or facial recognition.</p><p>MFA is an effective way to provide enhanced security. Traditional usernames and passwords can be stolen, and they’ve become increasingly more vulnerable to brute force attacks. MFA creates multiple layers of security to help increase the confidence that the user requesting access is actually who they claim to be. With MFA, a cybercriminal may steal one credential but will be thwarted by having to verify identity in a different manner.</p><p>Examples of Multi-Factor Authentication include using a combination of these elements to authenticate:</p><ul>\n<li>Codes generated by smartphone apps</li>\n<li>Badges, USB devices, or other physical devices</li>\n<li>Soft tokens, certificates</li>\n<li>Codes sent to an email address</li>\n<li>Answers to personal security questions</li>\n</ul><p>When it comes to MFA, we typically refer to two types of authentication factors:</p><ul>\n<li>Things you know (knowledge), such as a password or PIN</li>\n<li>Things you have (possession), such as a badge or smartphone</li>\n</ul>",
