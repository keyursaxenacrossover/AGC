It covers the development approach, testing methods, and limitations regarding accessibility compliance.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK\">Information</h1>\n<p>This guide focuses on the accessibility features and compliance of Responsive Layout Version 3.* and Portals with WCAG 2.0 AA recommendations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#wcag_overview\">WCAG Overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#development_approach\">Development Approach</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#testing_and_limitations\">Testing and Limitations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#support_and_improvements\">Support and Future Improvements</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"wcag_overview\">WCAG Overview</h2>\n<p>WCAG stands for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These guidelines are designed to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"development_approach\">Development Approach</h2>\n<p>Responsive Layout Version 3.* and Portals have been developed following best practices in accessibility and Web standards compliance. The development team followed WCAG 2.0 AA recommendations whenever possible during the creation of Responsive Layout 3.*.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"testing_and_limitations\">Testing and Limitations</h2>\n<p>The usability of Responsive Layout 3.* was tested in most common screen readers such as Jaws, NVDA, and MacOS VoiceOver. However, due to the wide range of available screen readers, their frequent updates, different interpretations of standards, and various methods for browsing web pages, error-free operation cannot be guaranteed in all available readers and their versions.</p>\n<p><strong>The layout was not externally tested and certified through an independent 3rd party, therefore we are unable to guarantee that our standard layout is 100% fulfilling all WCAG 2.0 AA requirements. Customers requiring a layout fulfilling a specific WCAG level should contact our professional services team.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"support_and_improvements\">Support and Future Improvements</h2>\n<p>The development team is committed to providing fixes for specific bugs or issues as soon as possible when made aware. If you can reproduce a specific bug or issue with a screen reader, please reach out to our support team.</p>\n<p>The mid-/long-term roadmap includes further accessibility improvements to survey layouts and additional accessible question types. These improvements aim to enhance standards compliance, support more recent WCAG recommendations, and improve usability for screen reader users.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863\">FAQ</h1>\n<h3 id=\"faq_wcag_compliance\">Is Responsive Layout Version 3.* fully WCAG 2.0 AA compliant?</h3>\n<p>While Responsive Layout Version 3.* was developed following WCAG 2.0 AA recommendations, we cannot guarantee 100% compliance as it has not been externally tested and certified by an independent 3rd party.</p>\n<h3 id=\"faq_custom_layout\">What if I need a layout that fulfills specific WCAG requirements?</h3>\n<p>Customers requiring a layout that fulfills specific WCAG levels should contact our professional services team for customized solutions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"faq_report_issues\">How can I report accessibility issues?</h3>\n<p>If you encounter any specific bugs or issues with screen readers, please contact our support team with detailed information about the problem and steps to reproduce it.</p>\n</article>",
