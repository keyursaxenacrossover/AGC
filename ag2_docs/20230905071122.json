EFS does not know in advance which answers the participant will give during the session. Therefore. the values of the progress indicator are calculated by an estimation algorithm.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\" data-renderer-start-pos=\"360\">You can deactivate the automatic calculation of the progress bar and set the values manually. To do this, go to Layout &gt; Professional Editor &gt; Progress bar and deactivate \"Calculate progress automatically\". Now you are able to indirectly define a value for the progress bar for each page by changing the numbers accordingly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863\">FAQ</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSJ1J4QXQJ8XQXP4NJ\">Where can I find more information about the progress bar?</h3>\n<p>For more detailed information about the progress bar, you can refer to the Layout documentation <a href=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20370257078034-Layout\">here.</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n</article>",
