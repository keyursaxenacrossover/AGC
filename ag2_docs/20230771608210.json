This right is not activated by default and must be specifically requested.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRTNR5QXQXJ1QXCX8QT\">Application Process</h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRTZ8KXBP0QXDQGHX8QT\">Step 1: Complete the Application</h3>\n<p>The licensee (person or entity who ordered/purchased the license) must complete and sign an application for combined data export.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRTGHJK3P0QXDQGHX8QT\">Step 2: Submit the Application</h3>\n<p>Return the completed application to Tivian for processing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRTQWE4P0QXDQGHX8QT\">Step 3: Account Verification</h3>\n<p>For legal reasons, activation can only be performed for accounts that are members of just one team. The team should be stated in the application.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRT5TY7P0QXDQGHX8QT\">Step 4: Rights Activation</h3>\n<p>Upon approval, the combined export right will be activated for all members of the specified team.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863\">FAQ</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRTUI8P0QXDQGHX8QT\">Where can I find the application form?</h3>\n<p>The application form for combined data export can be found in Tivian's download area.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRTOP9P0QXDQGHX8QT\">Will all team members receive the combined export right?</h3>\n<p>Yes, when activated, all members of the specified team will be granted this right.
