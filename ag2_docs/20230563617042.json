For example, instead of \"very satisfied\", use:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;img src=\"images/griening.gif\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" border=\"0\"&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Replace \"griening.gif\" with the name of your uploaded smiley image file.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRT5ALKSNSKXDXLQNKR\">Step 3: Copy File Path (Alternative Method)</h3>\n<p>Alternatively, you can copy the file path directly from the media library.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21013850122258\"></p>\n<h3><img src=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21013837870098\"></h3>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRT6BMLTOTLXEXMQNKR\">Step 4: Verify Results</h3>\n<p>After saving your changes, you should see smileys instead of text descriptions for each answer option.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863\">FAQ</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRT7CNMUPUTXFXNQNKR\">Can I use custom smiley images?</h3>\n<p>Yes, you can upload and use your own custom smiley images as long as they are in a supported file format (e.g., GIF, PNG, JPG).</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRT8DOVVQVTXGXOQNKR\">Is it possible to use smileys with other question types?</h3>\n<p>While the method described here works best with single response questions, you can adapt it for other question types that support custom HTML in answer options.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n</article>",
