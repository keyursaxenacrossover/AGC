    "body": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 2.1em;\">Overview</span></p>\n<article>\n<p>This article provides guidance on designing feedback questionnaires for multi-source feedback projects, focusing on displaying MSF data and using it in the condition editor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK\">Information</h1>\n<p>This guide covers specific features and functions related to creating questionnaires for multi-source feedback projects, including how to display MSF data and utilize it in the condition editor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01HGKSMPRT0YJQX3QJXD9XBPZ2\">Displaying MSF Data in the Questionnaire</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01HGKSMPRT8YJHXQX3QJXD9XBP\">Using MSF Data in Condition Editor</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRT0YJQX3QJXD9XBPZ2\">Displaying MSF Data in the Questionnaire</h2>\n<p>From EFS 10.3, piping simplifies the insertion of MSF-specific data in the questionnaire. A dedicated dialog shows all available data, allowing you to select the appropriate content easily. Here are some key points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Master data and process data are labeled as usual.</li>\n<li>Master data and process data of the focus person in the current feedback constellation are labelled with the prefix \"fb_recv_\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRT8YJHXQX3QJXD9XBP\">Using MSF Data in Condition Editor</h2>\n<p>In the condition editor, you can use feedback data for various purposes, such as filtering or hiding conditions. Here's what you need to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Master data and process data of the current participant are labelled as usual.</li>\n<li>Master data and process data of the focus person in the current feedback constellation are labelled with the prefix \"fb_recv_\". (E-mail and questionnaire wildcards follow the same scheme)</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863\">FAQ</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSJK3QX3QJXD9XBPZ3\">Where can I find the \"EFS Survey\" manual?</h3>\n<p>The \"EFS Survey\" manual is available via the online help. It can also be downloaded from the customer center.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGKSMPRSNM4XQJXD9XBPZ3Q\">What is the purpose of the \"fb_recv_\" prefix?</h3>\n<p>The \"fb_recv_\" prefix is used to label master data and process data of the focus person in the current feedback constellation. This helps distinguish between data related to the current participant and data related to the focus person.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tags: </strong>Multi-source feedback, Questionnaire design, MSF data, Condition editor, EFS Survey</p>\n</article>",
