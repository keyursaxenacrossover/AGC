The Privacy Assistant in Tivian's Enterprise Feedback Suite (EFS) is a feature designed to help users comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) when conducting surveys.</p>\n<p>Remember, once you activate the Privacy Assistant and set your project to \"Active,\" the status cannot be reversed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J4P4TP5DK5D7V5SB3SAHX4T8\">The Language Editor</h4>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20370986276242\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Language editor</a></strong></p>\n<p>Well, it is pretty obvious what this does: it helps with setting up multilingual surveys. Do note that there is no localization or automated translation available, so if any customer wants multilingual surveys, they would have to set up each item individual for each language.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J4P4VJ0P853P77TMV32AP5AV\">Triggers</h4>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20371021175698\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Triggers Topic Article</a></strong></p>\n<p>Triggers in EFS are automated actions that occur when specific conditions or events happen during a survey. They are designed to streamline processes and enhance the functionality of your surveys. For example, a mail trigger can be set up to send an email when a participant completes a certain page or meets a condition you've specified. This could be used to send a thank you message, a follow-up survey, or any other communication automatically.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J4P4VJ0P7B268B4C61HTWYEP\">Plausichecks (plausibility checks)</h4>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20230662387730\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How do I set up plausibility checks in questionnaires?</a></strong></p>\n<p>These checks basically make sure that the questionnaire is properly filled in by the participant. Think of these as the required fields that you see everywhere in online forms, so they are used to make sure that participants fill in the required data and also that it is the expected format (for example, that an email field has a valid email address or that a numeric value falls within the proper range)</p>",
