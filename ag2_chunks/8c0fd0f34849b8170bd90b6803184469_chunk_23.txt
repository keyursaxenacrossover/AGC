Is this still up-to-date?<br>Answer: No, since EFS 16.4 the default value is 50.000 and can be increased up to 200.000.</p><h3 id="header-79">(MySight new) Can the intermediate database be changed?</h3><p> Question: If a survey is not live, can the database be changed/switched without having to migrate the content (dump)? As far as we can see the data only is stored temporarily.<br>If the answer is yes, can this also be done for a survey that is live (given that this step is announced and prepared)?<br>Answer: The intermediate database only saves data temporarily until it is synched to the Exasol database. Therefore, we don't see any issues with changing/switching the intermediate database<br>independent from the status of the survey (live, not live) because the data (completed interviews) is put into a queue before being synched by the jobmaker.<br>You though have to stop the jobmaker before switching the database to avoid that data is synched during the switch.</p><h3 id="header-80">(MySight new) What happens to the data if MySQL and/or Exasol are temporarily not available?</h3><p> Question: Is the data stored to the Exasol databasae directly in case the intermediate database is temporarily not available? Answer: During the synch transactions are used. If for some reason the database should not be available, a rollback is executed and the completed interviews will remain in the queue.</p><h3 id="header-81">(MySight new) Are we able to manually sync not synched data (logfile analysis) and is this feasible (consistency)?</h3><p> Answer: It should not be necessary to manually sync data because of the transactions and the rollback in case of non availability. Non synched data will remain in the queue and will be synched during the next jobmaker execution.</p><h3 id="header-82">(MySight new) How can I add text variables as split variables /dimensions in Mysight?</h3><p> By default only integer variables can be used as split variables in mysight.<br>Since EFS 16.4 there is a new config flag that allows to enable specified text variables to be used as split as well: allowed_text_split.<br>Variables of type date can not be used as split variables.<br><br>Please make sure that these text variables though only include integer values or text values that are all the same or otherwise a split would not make sense. Please also mind that each additional split variable increases the risk of <strong>performance issues</strong> when tableau fetches data from Exasol.</p><h3 id="header-83">(MySight new) Failed Queries and what to do in that case (still needs to be documented)</h3><p></p><h4 id="header-85">[EXASOL][EX
