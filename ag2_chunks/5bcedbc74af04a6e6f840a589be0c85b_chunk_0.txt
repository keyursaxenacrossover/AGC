<h2 id="create-collective-ticket">Create Collective Ticket</h2>
<h3>Step 0</h3>
<p>Create a Collective Ticket in the JSM portal with the name "Expiring Organisations [DATE]" (e.g., "Expiring Organisations 01.03.2022"). In this ticket, request a list from 2nd level support of all organizations expiring on the specified date.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="receive-list">Receive List of Expiring Organizations</h2>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>1st level support receives the list of expiring organizations via JSM from 2nd level support in the collective ticket.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="find-contact-person">Find Contact Person</h2>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Identify the contact person in Sales for each organization and make a note in the organization's record.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="raise-ticket">Raise Ticket for Sales Representative</h2>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Create a ticket via the JSM portal for each responsible Sales Representative, including all organizations that belong to them. Add the Sales Representative as a Request Participant.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="link-ticket">Link New Ticket to Collective Ticket</h2>
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Link the newly created ticket for each Sales Representative to the collective ticket.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="follow-up">Follow Up with Sales Representative</h2>
<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>If you don't receive a reply from the Sales Representative and an organization is at risk of expiring, follow up via the ticket or Teams. Set a reminder to ensure the task is completed.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="extend-or-delete">Extend or Delete Organization</h2>
<h3>Step 6</h3>
<p>Based on the Sales Representative's response, either extend the organization's expiry date or initiate the deletion process:</p>

<h4>Step 6a: Extend organization</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Edit the Expiry Date in EFS</li>
  <li>Make a note for documentation (e.g., TIVI-20, 04.06.2021, extended by 1 year, fwo)</li>
  <li>Save correspondence with Sales in the ticket</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 6b: Delete organization</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Save correspondence with Sales in the ticket</li>
  <li>Open a new ticket for Sabine</li>
  <li>Sabine will delete the organization on the date specified by Sales</li>
  <li>Link the new ticket to the ticket with the Sales Representative</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="close-tickets">Close Tickets</h2>
<h3>Step 7</h3>
<p>Once you have received definitive feedback on each organization and implemented the necessary actions, close the ticket with the Sales Representative.</p>

<h3>Step 8</h3>
<p>After receiving feedback from all Sales Representatives and extending or deleting the organizations accordingly, close the collective ticket.</p>
