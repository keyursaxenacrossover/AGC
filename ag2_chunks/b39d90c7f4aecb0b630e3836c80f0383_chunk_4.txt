<h3 id="header-25">Displaying a page once after the first login</h3>
<p>On the sub-navigation field “Settings” under the tab “Page connections” you have the possibility to define a page in the CMS area of Portals, which can be used as a welcome page after the first login. On this page you can, for example, list notes for the next steps.</p>
<h3 id="header-26">Wildcards for the Text and Multimedia module of Portals</h3>
<p>The module Text and Multimedia, which is known from the module integration of portals, now has placeholders (#Wildcard#) in the editor that allow you to display user-related profile information and master data in the external view.</p>

<p>You create variables on the sub-navigation field “Settings” under the tab “Profile Settings”. A list of the variables available to you can also be displayed in the exterior view by typing #showWildcards# into the input line during module integration of the Text and Multimedia module. However, you should restrict this functionality to processing and development scenarios.</p>

After you have selected the additional information and integrated the Circles module on the sub-navigation field “Pages”, you have two drop-down lists that allow you to select two u_variables from the previously provided variables, as well as a link that take you back to the field “Settings”. You also have the option to leave the field blank. Then no descriptions are stored either.</p>
