<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK">Information</h1>
<p>If the DAC (Do-Answer-Check -&gt; mandatory question) is set for the entire question, the system only checks whether one answer option has been answered.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The DAC on the item level, on the other hand, means that an answer must be given to every answer item that has been enabled for DAC.</p>

<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863">FAQ</h1>
<h3 id="faq_question_1">What happens if I set DAC on question level?</h3>
<p>When DAC is set on question level, respondents are required to answer at least one item within the question, but not necessarily all items.</p>
<h3 id="faq_question_2">How does DAC on item level affect survey responses?</h3>
<p>DAC on item level requires respondents to provide an answer for every item that has been enabled for DAC within the question, ensuring more complete responses.</p>
