<h2 id="technical_considerations">Technical Considerations</h2>
<p>Before programming your survey, consider the following technical aspects to ensure accessibility and usability for all participants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base technical requirements on the lower level of possibilities in the target group</li>
<li>Consider data transmission, graphics usage, and programming techniques</li>
<li>Ensure acceptable loading times</li>
<li>Optimize readability for different screen sizes and resolutions</li>
<li>Make sure all options, including scales, question texts, and answer choices, are fully visible</li>
<li>Verify that options like "don't know" are visible to prevent result distortion</li>
</ul>

<p>Design questions so that all respondents understand them in the same way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3 id="tip_7">Create complete and non-overlapping answer categories</h3>

<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863">FAQ</h1>
<h3 id="faq_1">Why is it important to consider technical aspects when creating an online survey?</h3>
<p>Considering technical aspects ensures that no participants are excluded from taking the survey due to technical limitations. It helps maintain accessibility, usability, and data integrity across various devices and internet connections.</p>
<h3 id="faq_2">How can I avoid leading questions in my survey?</h3>
<p>To avoid leading questions, maintain a neutral tone and phrasing. Present all options equally and avoid using language that might influence the respondent's answer. Have others review your questions to check for potential bias.</p>
<h3 id="faq_3">What should I do if I need to ask about multiple related topics?</h3>
<p>If you need to ask about multiple related topics, break them down into separate questions. This approach ensures clarity and prevents confusion, allowing respondents to provide more accurate and focused answers for each topic.</p>
