 add them to a circle. For the module page integration, you make the following settings: You assign a heading, select an e-mail template and a panel group to which the persons to be invited are to be added by using the drop-down list.

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><span style="color: #091e42;">After successful integration, the module can be accessed from the portal's exterior view.  </span>Clicking the button <strong>Invite user</strong> opens a modal, inviting future users by entering their e-mail address, first name, and surname. If you want to invite several users at the same time, you can proceed in two ways: Either you click on <strong>add another</strong> to add further user invitations by entering the email address, first name, and last name, or you click on <strong>add multiple at once</strong>.#</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><span style="color: #091e42;">In this case, type in a free text field the first and last name and the e-mail address, whereby not only the first name, last name, and e-mail address are separated by a semicolon, but two semicolons are set for the listing after each user is invited.  </span>In addition, a Circle can be selected in advance to which users who accept the invitation will be added. After the invitations have been sent, a table is created with all users who have received an invitation. It can be sorted by the column headers of the header. As long as an invitation has not been accepted, the status remains “Invited“. As soon as the user clicks on the link sent with the invitation e-mail and clicks on “Register“ after filling in the registration form, the status changes, and the user is logged on to the portal.</p>
