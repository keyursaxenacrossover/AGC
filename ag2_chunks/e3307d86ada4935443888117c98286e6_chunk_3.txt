<h3 id="header-15">Guide Waves</h3>
<p>Since the summer 2019 release, the<em> Guide Waves</em> page module is available to the<em> Ideation Guide</em>. From Fall 2019 release, this module will also be available to the<em> Team Improvement Guide</em> (<em>US-Guide</em>) and the<em> Leadership Guide</em> (<em>ME-Guide</em>). As part of the <em>Team Improvement Guide</em> (<em>ME-Guide</em>), you can also use the option item "Consult group again".</p>
<h3 id="header-16">E-mail Delivery Status</h3>
<p>The <strong>E-mail delivery status</strong> of a guide now has an additional status. In addition to "delivered" and "not delivered" there is the status "pending", which indicates that e-mails are still in the queue. Also, the display has changed slightly: Instead of an icon, the status is now displayed as text. In addition, participants in a survey are grouped according to the <strong>rater groups</strong> from which they originate. Click on the name of the group to open the list of participants.</p>
