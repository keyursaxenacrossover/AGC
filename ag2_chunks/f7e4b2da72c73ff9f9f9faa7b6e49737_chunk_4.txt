 the split button allows you to import participant codes from a file into participant administration. Each row of the file is interpreted as one code. Therefore, the file should not contain a header. A participant is created for each code. The remaining participant data (e.g. name, password) are set automatically.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">For each imported code, a dummy account will be created. E-mail addresses on the @3uu.eu domain are used for these accounts. These addresses are owned by Tivian, mails sent to them are deleted automatically.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Please insert import codes into the text field below, each line one code. Per code one account will be created if code doesn't already exist.</p>
