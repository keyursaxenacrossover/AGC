<h1 id="header-16">IdP activation mail</h1>
<p><strong>Case</strong>: An existing user <strong>without </strong>a customer (external) IdP wants to login into EFS / Portals with Tivian access for the first time</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When QA module is activated and existing users are synced to Okta each user will be added to the IdP database and get an activation mail generated by Okta</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User clicks on activation link and lands on a page where he can set a new password</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the new password is set, the user is forwarded to a generic destination page “Welcome to Tivian Access”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If user starts his app he lands on (Okta) login page where he enters his e-mail address and his defined password and gets redirected to EFS / Portals</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Case</strong>: An existing user <strong>with </strong>a customer (external) IdP wants to login into EFS / Portals with Tivian access for the first time</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When customer IdP is connected to Okta IdP users will be synced to Okta and thus added to the IdP database automatically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since user are logged in their own Active directory where passwords are also managed they don’t need a password from Okta and thus they <strong>don’t get</strong> an activation mail</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such users start a Tivian app and land on Discovery page where to enter their e-mail address in order to be logged into the app directly without adding their password</p>
</li>
</ul>
