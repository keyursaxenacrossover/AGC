Only customization seems to be a tricky part in our specific use case (there are multiple solution; they may just need a little bit more effort). There are a few minor missing parts or unclear documentation. Okta seems to be a living product that is used and understood by major players. It is more focused on company internal SSO, but offers very good IdP solutions that can be offered to our clients.</p><p><ac:parameter ac:name="colour">Green</ac:parameter><ac:parameter ac:name="title">Recommended</ac:parameter></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2 id="header-9">Additional Explanation:</h2><p><br><ac:parameter ac:name="">*1</ac:parameter></p><p>*1: With a custom policy possibly, but not out of the box and not without massive effort</p><p><br><ac:parameter ac:name="">*2</ac:parameter></p><p>*2: In case of custom policies the logging seems to be useless.
