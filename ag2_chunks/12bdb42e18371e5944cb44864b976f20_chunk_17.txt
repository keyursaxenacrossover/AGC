<h2 id="plausibility-checks" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Plausibility checks</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Internet surveys permit quality checks and data checks as early as during entry. Minor errors and missing information can thus be noted immediately during entry. The respondent will receive a short message indicating that they may have overlooked something. You will not have to ask follow-up questions afterward but can correct the incorrect information immediately during entry instead. Checks for the correctness of answers are commonly referred to as “plausibility checks”. This term is also used in this manual.</p>
<h3 id="why-plausibility-checks" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Why plausibility checks?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Plausibility checks are used to ensure a certain level of data quality. Sometimes, respondents will overlook a question or commit minor errors when setting an answer. Sometimes, questions are also answered incompletely, if the respondent for example wants to get an overview of the questionnaire first or completes the questionnaire without serious interest. The information given should be checked especially if branchings at later stages in the questionnaire are based on the answers to preceding questions. Plausibility checks are advisable in the following cases:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>The answer to the question is taken up in later questions, either in a filter condition or in a display of dynamic questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assuring fill-in instructions, such as “Select the three most important properties of products xy”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Answers to a specific question are of particular interest for the evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The internal consistency of the data is of particular importance for the evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data being queried already exists in participant administration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="planning-the-use-of-plausibility-checks" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Planning the Use of Plausibility Checks</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Be aware of which answers are important for the routing of the survey and which data are central to the evaluation purpose. However, use plausibility checks with care. For the respondent, plausibility checks are, first and foremost, annoying and tiresome because their behavior is questioned and their progress through the survey is hindered. Too many
