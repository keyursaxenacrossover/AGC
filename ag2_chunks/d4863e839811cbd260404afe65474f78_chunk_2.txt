<ul>
<li>PS: Requests for changes or enhancements to functionality, such as new features or additional custom modules, should always be routed to PS.</li>
</ul>
<li>Master Data Handling:</li>
<ul>
<li>PS: If the issue is related to the import/export or configuration of master data that involves custom handling, it's a PS task.</li>
<li>CS: If it's a problem with the usage of master data within a survey that is functioning otherwise, route to CS.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Examples of Ticket Routing</p>
<ul>
<li>Ticket Example 1: "The survey did not generate after the latest dictionary upload."</li>
<ul>
<li>Route to PS: This is a survey generation issue linked to the dictionary conversion process.</li>
</ul>
<li>Ticket Example 2: "Panelists are not routed correctly based on their master data in the survey."</li>
<ul>
<li>Route to CS: This is an issue with survey routing logic and does not involve custom modules or dictionary imports.</li>
</ul>
<li>Ticket Example 3: "We did not receive the expected export files on our SFTP server."</li>
<ul>
<li>Route to PS: This is an export-related issue likely linked to the custom SFTP configuration or custom export processes.</li>
</ul>
<li>Ticket Example 4: "The survey is active, but users report that one of the questions isn't displaying correctly."</li>
<ul>
<li>Route to CS: Since the survey is already active, this falls under standard survey functionality issues.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
