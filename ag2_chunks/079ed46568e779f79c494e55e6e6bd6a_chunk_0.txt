<p>This article explains how to efficiently create surveys by using depot questions.</p>
<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK">Information</h1>
<p>If you want to use a question multiple times in your questionnaire, you can define a so called <strong><a href="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20370806049810-Container-depot">depot question</a>.</strong> During survey creation, you can then place the depot question on all respective pages. </p>
<p>Later on, it is not necessary to edit each of the questions individually if you have to change these frequently recurring questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Step 1: Switch to the Questionnaire editor and click on the "Container depot" menu item. </li>
<li>Click on "+ New question" and enter a question title. </li>

<li>Confirm by clicking "Save" </li>

<li>Confirm by clicking "Save"</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Please note that changes to the depot question affect all other reference questions.</p>

<h3 id="faq1">Can I edit a depot question after I've used it in my survey?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can edit a depot question at any time. However, keep in mind that changes to the depot question will affect all instances where it's used in your survey.</p>
<h3 id="faq2">Are there any limitations to using depot questions?</h3>
<p>While depot questions are very useful for consistency and efficiency, it's important to use them judiciously. Make sure that the question truly needs to be repeated and that the same wording and answer options are appropriate for all instances where it's used.</p>
