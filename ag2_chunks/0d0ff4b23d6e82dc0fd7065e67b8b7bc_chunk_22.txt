<li>
<p>A Power Point report (PPT, PPTX) or a PDF report generated on the basis of Power Point can contain a maximum of 250 slides. An Excel report can contain a maximum of 250 work sheets, i.e., 250 chapters. A work sheet can have a maximum of 256 columns and 65,000 rows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The generation of reports in Excel, PPT, PPTX and PDFs requires a web service running via a .NET server. If your installation is hosted externally in a closed system, an additional Windows server is required for report generation.</p>

<h3 id="the-generation-process" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>The generation process</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">When generating a report, the statistical values will be updated once again. If you were working with test data, the real data will be inserted automatically and the statistical values will be calculated. Afterwards, the completed report will be converted into a file of the desired format.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">This is a resource-intensive process. To ensure a good performance of the installation, it will be executed as follows:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>If it is only one report, it will be generated instantly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If several generation processes are initiated at the same time - if either you or several different users wish to generate different reports - then these generation requests will be placed in a queue and processed successively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as the generation of your report is completed, you will be notified via email.</p>
