ysiwyg-text-align-justify">The language displayed at the start of the survey can be set via a data item known in advance, such as information from participant administration. In the “Read language selection by survey start from” drop-down list, you can define the variable from which the ID of the displayed language will be read at the start of the survey. Which variables are available depends on the project type:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p><em>Anonymous projects</em>: URL parameters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Personalized projects</em>: The standard variables in participant administration except “c_date” and “m_date”, and all additionally created participant variables as well as URL parameters. If you would like to use a participant variable, especially for saving language information, then use the standard variable “u_language” which was introduced especially for this purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Panel and master data surveys</em>: Participant data, master data, system data, and URL parameters</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="entering-the-language-setting-variable-in-participant-administration" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Entering the language-setting variable in participant administration</h3>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>In language administration, specify from which variable the language setting is to be read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirm your entry by clicking on <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch to <strong>Participant administration</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you select the <strong>Add participant</strong> button, you will find that the data item that was defined as the language variable (in the example shown below, the language version stored in u_language) can no longer be freely entered but only selected via a drop-down list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now proceed entering or importing the participant data as usual.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If the participant data were entered before setting the language variable, the drop-down list will automatically be completed and set to the default language. Then, it is necessary to add the language data for the participants. Therefore it is strongly recommended to configure languages and participant variables before adding participant data.</p>
<h3 id="tracing-changes-made-in-language-administration-via-the-log" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Tracing changes made in language administration via the log</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The “Language selection log” section displays important operations within language administration (e.g. creating and deleting languages and changing the default language) in chronological order. Therefore, you can also see here, among other things, who last changed the default language and is thus responsible for unblocking the language selection.</p>
<h2 id="text-elements" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Text elements</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If you want to edit the text elements of your multilingual project directly in<em> EFS</em> instead of using the “External editing” function, the text element editor will be central to your work, because here you can edit the text elements of your questionnaire page by page.</p>
<h3 id="ways-to-the-text-element-editor" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Ways to the text element editor</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Once you have created more than one language for a project, there are three possible ways of accessing the text element editor:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>As described above, clicking on the <strong>Language Editor</strong> → <strong>Text elements</strong> menu item in the questionnaire editor will take you to the overview of translation to-dos. Selecting one item from the to-do list will open the text element editor for the corresponding page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the page view, you only have to click on the <strong>Text Elements</strong> menu to access the text elements of the current page.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="overview-of-the-translation-process" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Overview of the translation process</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Clicking on the <strong>Questionnaire editor → Language editor → Text elements</strong> menu item will take you to the overview of translation to-dos. Here, you can see where there are still untranslated text elements in your questionnaire.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>All text elements in the text element editor that have been filled in the default language should be filled in the additional languages, too. I.e. the pages of the default language will always be marked <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Until all the text elements of an additional language have been completed in the text element editor, the table will output the <strong>Edit</strong> message for the respective page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once all the text elements of a language have been completed, the table will output<br>the <strong>OK</strong> message for the respective page.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can click on the <strong>OK</strong> and <strong>Edit</strong> messages and
