<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><em>EFS Reporting+</em> provides enhanced support for multilingual projects. From now on, if you want to create report versions with identical content and structure, but text elements from various languages, it is sufficient to create a single report.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Via <strong>Report → Language</strong>, you can switch between the default language of your questionnaire and the language you selected when creating the report. If you selected the <strong>All Languages</strong> option when creating the report, all languages that were created for the questionnaire are available for selection under <strong>Report → Language</strong>. The content of the structure window and workpad is reloaded automatically, containing the text elements for the selected language. The labels in the sources window are not affected by the switch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initially, the original text elements from the questionnaire are inserted. If you change texts in <em>EFS Reporting+</em>, e.g. via the table editor, they are stored and kept in the background when you switch to another language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When exporting, you can select the language whose text elements are to be inserted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you insert key figures and aggregations, you can modify the labels in the various language versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please mind that standard texts e.g. the table headers for “Answer option” and “Code” can only be displayed either in English or in German. During the creation of the report, they are automatically preset in the current admin area language, or in English if you‘re using Finnish, French,
