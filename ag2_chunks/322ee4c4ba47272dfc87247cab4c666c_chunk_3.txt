 5 files with a maximum individual file size of 8MB can be added to each action in the board.</p>
<p><u>Do not send e-mails</u></p>
<p>Email notification are fine, but some users asked for more control. So from now on you can also use the option “no emails” in the module configuration of the<em> Action Board</em> module to send no e-mail notifications for that particular trigger. Note that if you select this option, then neither e-mails nor push messages are sent, even if those notification options have been activated in the user profile.</p>

<h3 id="header-12">Module modifications</h3>
<p><u>Task List</u></p>
<p>The Task List module connects directly to the Action Planner in EFS, and is very useful for complex workflows like Closed Loop Feedbacks. So we’ve added support for the file upload/download to this, too.</p>
<p>After upload, files are displayed in the tasks, but only for those who have access to this task. You also have a new sort order that allows you to sort the tasks in ascending or descending order by title, end date, status, or creation. A maximum of 5 files, with a maximum file size of 8MB can be added to each task.</p>

<p><u>Portal invitation: role selection </u></p>
<p>In the <em>Portal invitation</em> module, you can now define the role to which the invited persons are assigned to. The<br>available roles are: Moderator, Survey Manager and Translation Manager. If you choose “Select all”, then all roles will be assigned to the invited person. If you do not select a role, the invited person will be assigned a default Participant role.</p>

<p><u>Displaying topics</u></p>
<p>For the <em>Cards</em> and <em>Discussion modules</em> of <em>Portals</em>, you can now display the topics on the tiles, which you create under the Topic tab. So when you start a new discussion in the external view, you can choose from the topics created in the CMS area of Portals. The selected topics will then appear on the corresponding discussion tile. Two of the selected topics also appear on the discussion tile of the <em>Cards</em> module if you have shared the corresponding discussion board in the module configuration of the <em>Cards</em> module.</p>

<h3 id="header-13">User managed groups</h3>
<p>To avoid confusion when managing groups in <em>Portals</em>, we’ve made it simpler. The person who creates a User-managed group is defined as the ‘owner’. Only group members can view a public group, and only the owner can edit the group. Thus, only group owners can publish or make changes to a groups. This is consistent across all modules in<em> Portals</em>, so when inviting new people to a Portal using the <em>Portal Invitation</em> module you can only select groups that you are the owner of.</p>
<h3 id="header-14">‘Blue collar’ worker scenario</h3>
<p>It’s one of the biggest problems for organizations wanting to survey their employees: pretty much everyone has access to a device to respond on, but how do you get the survey invitations to people who don’t have an email address? This is what we refer to as the ‘Blue Collar’ scenario. We refer to people who don’t have email addresses in EFS as ‘offline participants’.</p>
<p>We want this to be as simple as possible, so in Guides, you can now invite offline users. This does require some setup and configuration before you get started:</p>
<p>To declare panelists as offline participants, first set the new master data m_offlineusers to 1 (= yes) in the Panelist administration of the People module. In Guides (in Portals) select the appropriate template under the <strong>E-mail Settings</strong> tab of and configure the code voucher under the <strong>Offline Participants</strong> tab. These voucher are then sent by email as a PDF to the person who initiated the survey in Guides. They can also be downloaded from the Guide Status page in Portals. The intention is for the person who initiates the Guide to then print off the vouchers, and distributed them in person to the offline participants. The vouchers include a unique participation code, a QR code that links to the survey, the first and last name of the participant and the survey URL.</p>

<p>Offline participants are then free to access the survey, either directly using the URL or by scanning the QR code with their own mobile devices. They will be prompted to enter their participant code before completing the survey.</p>
