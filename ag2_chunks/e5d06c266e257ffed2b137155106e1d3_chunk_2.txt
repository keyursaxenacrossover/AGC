<h4 id="header-11">Evaluation of an improvement</h4>
<p>After moving an improvement ticket into the column "Done", you have the possibility to rate it by clicking on the button "Evaluate" visible only in this column. In the detail view you will now find a scale<br>from 1 to 5 on which you can rate the improvement. The rating must be confirmed. Once a user has rated a ticket, it can no longer be removed from the "Done" column.</p>
<h4 id="header-12">Archiving an improvement</h4>
<p>An improvement is archived either automatically after all users have rated it, or manually by clicking on "Archive" under the more option. Tickets that have been archived can only be commented. Other functions are no longer available. Improvements cannot be reactivated either. The archived improvements can be hidden or displayed. If you decide to display archived improvements, the board view changes and an archive table is displayed with the column headings "Title", "Person Responsible" and "Shared". You determine how many improvements per page are listed in the table. You use the information icon to jump to the detailed view.</p>

<p>Check the option "List-Unsubscribe Header" in the "Advanced mail settings" and paste a link or a header. You have the following options for the input field:</p>

<h3 id="header-22">Five variables for the Extended Search</h3>
<p>Since the winter release, the menu item “Sample” available for the project type "Panel survey" has had a second tab: “Search in all samples”. If you call this tab, a free text field search and a table with the column headings “First name”, “Last name”, “E-mail”, “Panel status”, “Code”, “Mails sent”, “Status”, “Date of first invitation” and “Last access” are displayed. With the Extended Search you can now add up to five variables, which you can select by drop-down list. To further refine the search, you define a specification for each added variable. The specification is added to the table.</p>
<h3 id="header-23">Convenient folder structure</h3>
<p>Due to the restructuring of the folder structure, it is now easier for MySight users to understand and use MySight folders in Tableau. Folders are created and the variables are grouped in these folders.</p>
<h3 id="header-24">New table structure</h3>
<p>Now MySight has a five-level table structure with unique labels. The column headers are: QuestionID, QuestionTitle, QuestionSubtitle, ResponseOption and EXT_Variable.</p>
<h3 id="header-25">Grouping filters for the export of the panel data</h3>
<p>In the People module, you can create grouping filters now to filter panel data during export. You use the conditions you have specified. A group does not have to exist. The condition is created under: People -&gt; Groups -&gt; Grouping filters –&gt; Filter conditions. You select the desired grouping filter in the export settings.</p>
