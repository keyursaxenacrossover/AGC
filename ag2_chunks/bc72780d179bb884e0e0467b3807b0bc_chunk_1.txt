It is not configured per application as before but per group of users. As with single-sign-on capabilities a configuration per application is not sufficient anymore.</p><p>A sane default will be implemented for every of our customerâ€™s. If there is the need to further enhance password strength and a customer asks for that, the password policies for that client could be adapted.</p><p>Especially password complexity, password age and lock-mechanisms can be configured.</p><p>Ask 2nd-level support or the <a href="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/wiki/people/team/6b96c6d8-d2c6-4808-8d17-c77b837d20d2?ref=confluence&amp;src=fabric">IAM</a>-team.</p><p></p><h4 id="header-9"><strong>How can the emails from Okta be customized ?</strong></h4><p>Unfortunately we do not offer an email customization option right now.</p><p>All Emails will be sent out using the currently configured style in Okta.</p><p></p><h4 id="header-10"><strong>Can I configure the sender of the Okta emails for a customer?</strong></h4><p>No. Email from Okta are send out using the sender &lt;noreply@okta.com&gt;</p><p>This might change in future.</p><p></p><h4 id="header-11"><strong>Can I configure password policies only for specific users?</strong></h4><p>Yes, that is possible, but if there are a lot of different rules it will be hard to manage users.</p><p></p><h4 id="header-12"><strong>What characters are allowed when creating users?</strong></h4><p>For email addresses only characters specified in RFC 3696 Section 3 are supported.</p><p>For first and last name 4-byte characters are not supported.</p><p>For more details see: <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Directory/Reference_Directories.htm">https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Directory/Reference_Directories.htm</a></p><p></p><h4 id="header-13"><strong>I try to configure Okta but I am not able to see the Okta admin view.
