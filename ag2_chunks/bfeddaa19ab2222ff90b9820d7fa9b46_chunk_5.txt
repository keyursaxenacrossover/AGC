<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">This chapter shows you how to create panel pages with the help of modules and templates.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>First of all, this chapter explains how content and functions, located in a panel page’s content area, are put together with the help of modules.</li>
<li>It also explains how the general structure of panel pages is created through the interaction of different templates.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="panel-pages-content-area" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Panel Pages’ Content Area</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">A panel page’s content area is the part that contains the actual page content: Information texts, forms, and functions. This area differs from page to page, whereas other parts, such as header and menu, remain largely consistent.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The introduction of this chapter already took you through the practical steps of filling a panel page’s content area in the new CMS: You choose modules that provide the desired content and functions, and assemble these modules on the page.</p>

<h2 id="panel-page-structure" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Panel Page Structure</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Browsing the panel’s external view you will discover that the content area, which is defined with the help of modules, differs from page to page, but many other panel page components remain the same:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>The border area always looks the same.</li>
<li>The appearance of the navigation bar and login area changes upon login but is the same on all external pages as well as on all internal pages.</li>
</ul>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">This is technically implemented with the help of the template concept: The panel pages are broken down into logical components, each of which is generated by different files (templates). The general panel page structure is defined in the main template. In this template, the components are inserted using wildcards. The Smarty template engine only dynamically replaces the data provided by the respective templates once the pages are delivered to the viewer’s browser.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Advantages of the template concept</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The most important advantage of the template concept is that implementing a change, for example to the navigation bar, requires only a one-time change to the source code of the respective template. By contrast, if you were to build the panel in such a way that each page (e.g. start page, “About us” page, panelists’ personal homepage) contained the entire HTML code, a change would have to be made, for example, to the navigation bar on every single page. That is a time-consuming and error-prone process.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Furthermore, this method of building pages with the help of several templates enables you to realize status-dependent components. For example, the navigation bar, login area, and content area may look different to visitors who have not logged in than to logged-in panelists.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Example: The structure of the “Contact Us” page</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In the standard panel, a normal panel page contains the following elements, each of which is defined in separate templates:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Language selection: This field is only displayed for websites with several language versions.</p>
<ol class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>Navigation: The menus displayed in the navigation depend on whether or not the viewer is logged in.</li>
<li>Messages</li>
<li>Login: Depending on whether or not the viewer is logged in, this area contains different functions, which in turn are defined by two different templates.</li>
<li>Content area: This is filled for each page with the help of content and function modules. Module-specific templates define how the data provided by the modules are output. The illustration shows the content of the “About Us” page.</li>
<li>Subnavigation</li>
</ol>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The main template is responsible for the general structure of the page and for inserting the various individual components into the overall context.</p>
