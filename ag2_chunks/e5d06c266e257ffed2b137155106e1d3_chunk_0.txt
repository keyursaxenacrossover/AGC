<h3 id="header-3">The Improvements module: To improve the improvement</h3>
<p>To initiate the improvement of engagement, the traditional approaches have been evolved. This development presents the current solution for such applications, the Action Planner, with a challenge. This module uses an organizational structure that restricts the actions to hierarchically coordinated actions and proves inflexible when teams are dynamically assembled. The new improvements module is designed for another use cases. By using the share function, fluctuating team compositions are possible and a commentary function and a lean evaluation option provide the key to sustainable commitment. The measures enacted from above will be replaced by the active cooperation.</p>
<h3 id="header-5">The page integration of the new module and the first steps</h3>
<p>The page module integration in the CMS area of Portals finds no trouble: You place the module Improvements on a page and enter a heading. After that the module is already available in the exterior view. You use the button “Export list” to export important information in an excel list. The list contains the information of the persons who created the improvement, with whom it is shared and who is responsible. The exterior view of the user interface is clearly arranged and easy to handle. The new module offers you a search function and a board that is equipped with the columns “Inbox”, “Ongoing” and “Done”. The three columns help you to document the progress of a ticket. An improvement ticket is created by clicking on the button “Create improvement”. The corresponding ticket is generated in the column “Inbox”. This is furnished with a catchy title by you before the work starts. You sort the tickets horizontally and vertically via drag &amp; drop. Initially, the tickets can be moved back and forth as desired. The improvements are always in the same status for you and every other user.</p>

<h4 id="header-7">The improvement ticket and the detail view</h4>
<p>Each improvement ticket has two icons on the right side of the ticket. They allow a quick orientation, i.e. whether the improvement is already shared and who the person responsible is. Clicking on the<br>ticket or its title gives you access to the detail view. There you share the Improvement with Circles and users who will work on it together, and you also equip the Improvement with a topic in which you can participate by means of the comment function. Any hierarchy, such as an organizational structure, is omitted. Besides you designate one of the
