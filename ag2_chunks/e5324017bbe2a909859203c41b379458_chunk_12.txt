<p data-renderer-start-pos="1533">Not tested does not mean not working. Please contact 2nd level support or the IAM team to find out if an integration is possible or not.</p>
<h4 id="How-is-an-Identity-Provider-tested-?" data-renderer-start-pos="1671"><strong data-renderer-mark="true">How is an Identity Provider tested ?</strong></h4>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="1709">Identity Providers are tested by testing out the login to Okta via the Identity Provider. Testing an Identity Provider does not require Tivian Access to be activated in EFS. The integration can be tested only with Okta and does not impact any business.<br><strong data-renderer-mark="true"><u data-renderer-mark="true">Please note</u></strong>: In order to successfully test an Identity Provider, Tivian needs at least access to a test user present in the Identity Provider.</p>

<p data-renderer-start-pos="2161">This depends on the case. In case all information is provided by the customer it could only take a few minutes. In case some information is missing or the integration is not working some interaction is required with the customer (which may take some time depending on how the communication is handled).</p>

<p data-renderer-start-pos="2509">As part of the 19.5 EFS Winter release, we do not support social Identity Providers.</p>

<p data-renderer-start-pos="2703">OpenID Connect is the preferred standard but SAML is also possible. If both are offered choose OpenID Connect.</p>

<p data-renderer-start-pos="2889">Yes, multiple Identity Providers can be configured in Okta. The identity provider where the user has to authenticate is chosen based on the email address (domain) the user provided.</p>

<p data-renderer-start-pos="3446">The IdP ID directly redirect the a user to the respective Identity Provider. But you can create a request on your own to navigate to Okta without the IdP ID. The easiest way to achieve that is by looking at the network traffic in your browser (see <a class="cc-1rn59kg" title="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network" data-testid="link-with-safety" data-render
