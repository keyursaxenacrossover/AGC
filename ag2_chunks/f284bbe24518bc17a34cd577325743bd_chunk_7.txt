<h1 id="h_01J4KMC3H0YXQ01BAXG1XMQ84A">Continuous Tasks</h1>
<p>There are several different occasions where tasks have to run independently from a request-response cycle. Reasons for that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>time based tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tasks that would run too long in a request-response cycle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tasks that are run in background as they are not bound to any request-response cycle but other triggers like database entries</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For this purpose a dedicated machine is setup that runs these different tasks. There are four overall concepts that run these tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>snailmail:</strong> Snailmail is a cronjob that executes a fixed script to send out emails</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>dbreport:</strong> The DB Report is also a fixed script that gets executed as a cronjob. Is cleans up the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>jobmaker:</strong> The Jobmaker is a cronjob that relies on tasks in a database table. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>custom cron jobs:</strong> Custom cron jobs are used to run installation specific custom tasks that are requested by a customer and implemented as a customization for the installation. The tasks they fulfill depend on the requested solution.</p>
