<strong>Creating and configuring the </strong><em><strong>Task Trigger</strong></em>
</h2>
<p>With the <em>Task Trigger,</em> you can create <strong>new tasks</strong> in Employee projects for survey projects. The <em>Task Trigger</em> can automatically be executed in a survey after the response to a question. Depending on how a survey participant has answered a certain question, the<em> Task Trigger</em> creates a task in the<em> Action Planner</em> which has been predefined for this purpose. The<em> Task Trigger</em> can be created on any page of the survey project. If the <em>Task Trigger</em> is created on the final page, for example, it will be triggered upon completion of the survey. The <em>Task Trigger</em> is configured on the basis of a selected Employee project storing the required organizational structure and the respective Action module the <em>Task Trigger</em> accesses when triggering the task. A number of conditions and settings define if a task is created and what content is stored in this task. The target unit for a task needs to be provided in a variable of the originating survey. In case a unit cannot be found, a survey runtime error is thrown and the survey‘s error notification recipients will be notified. The survey wildcards can be used to dynamically fill Action Planner variables. Conditions can be defined to provide different content based on predefined rules. Default fields for defining the task cannot be removed and must have a value.</p>
<p>To create the Task Trigger, proceed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Navigate via the following path to the Task Trigger in your survey project:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[Selected project] → <strong>Questionnaire editor</strong> → [Selected page] → <strong>Triggers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Trigger list is opened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the button <strong>+ Trigger</strong>.</
