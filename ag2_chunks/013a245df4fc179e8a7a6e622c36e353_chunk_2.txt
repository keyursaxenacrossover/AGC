<strong>Identifier for the </strong><em><strong>MySight</strong></em><strong> Page Module</strong>
</h3>
<p>To control the <em>MySight</em> page module via the Portal Api, you can assign a unique identifier in the module configuration. This identifier is appended to the DOM element of the <em>MySight</em> module. By default, no value is assigned.</p>
<h3 id="header-12"><strong>Push Notifications</strong></h3>
<p>From now on, push notifications will no longer be delivered if users have logged off from the portal app or if the panel status of the user is <em>inactive</em>. In this way, both users and panel admins can decide whether push notifications are received.</p>

<strong>Enhancements for </strong><em><strong>Guides</strong></em>
</h2>
<p>The process control of the <em>Leadership-Guide</em> (ME Guide) has been improved. To present the result of your <em>Team Improvement Guide</em> (US-Guide), you are now able to use predefined dashboard templates. You can now delete a guide processes.</p>
<h3 id="header-16"><strong>Allow Deletion of Guide Processes (ME- &amp; US-Guide)</strong></h3>
<p>In order to provide a better overview of the completed guide processes, the completed guide processes of the guide types ME- and US-Guide can now also be deleted. Therefore, on the<strong> Settings</strong> tab, you have a new option to allow the guide initator to delete guide processes.</p>
<p><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998053312786" alt="basic_settings.png"></p>
<p>Processes that have already ended can be deleted from your portal via the 3-point menu. Before the final deletion, a dialog window opens in which the deletion must be confirmed. Deleting guide processes means that the survey data of the associated PE-project is deleted for the corresponding guide process.</p>
<p>This option is activated by default!</p>
<h3 id="header-17"><strong>One-time Extension of the Field Time of a Guide Process (ME- &amp; US-Guide)</strong></h3>
<p>The guide initiator has the unique opportunity to extend the field time of an already started guide process, if you enable this setting. Thus, e.g. with moderate success of a guide survey the number of participants can be increased.</p>
<p><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20997998915730" alt="extend_the_process_once.png"></p>
<p>If the process is extended by the guide initiator, a last-call reminder e-mail will be sent to those participants who have not yet participated. Select the template for the last-call reminder e-mail on the <strong>E-mail Settings</strong> tab of the <strong>Guides</strong> sub-navigation. If you do not want to send an additional reminder e-mail (a last-call reminder e-mail) simply leave the field empty.</p>
<p>If the field time has already expired, an extension can no longer be performed even if the option is activated.</p>
<h3 id="header-18"><strong>One-time Sending of a Reminder E-mail (ME- &amp; US-Guide)</strong></h3>
<p>From now on, reminder e-mails can only be sent once per Rater Group. This also applies to automatically sent reminder e-mails. So once a reminder e-mail has been sent - manually or automatically - you can't send another reminder email.</p>
<h3 id="header-19"><strong>Predefined Dashboard Templates (US-Guide)</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to the <em>MySight</em> dashboards, predefined dashboard templates can now be selected for the <em>Team Improvement Guide</em> (US Guide) to present the results of a US Guide survey. For this purpose, you have the new <strong>Results</strong> tab on the <strong>Guides</strong> sub-navigation. On this tab you can use radio buttons to choose between <strong>MySight Dashboard</strong> and <strong>Dashboard Configuration</strong>. If you choose <strong>MySight Dashboard</strong>, the familiar MySight configuration guide for your guide results will be displayed. If you select <strong>Dashboard Configuration</strong>, the available dashboard templates are displayed. Depending on the template, you have a wide range of settings.</p>
<h2 id="header-21"><strong>Enterprise Feedback Suite</strong></h2>
<p><em>EFS</em> has also been improved. The search function of the participant list has been improved. The preview for e-mail templates has been revised, so that creating these templates can now be done in no time at all. Among other new features, the pages of the questionnaire can now be marked as finished. </p>
<h3 id="header-23"><strong>New Search Function for the Participant List</strong></h3>
<p>The search function of the participant list has been revised, so that now large amounts of participants can be searched with a minimum of time. The search is divided into two sections: "Fields with index" and "Fields without index".</p>
