<h3 id="importing-an-organizational-structure" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Importing an organizational structure</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Instead of manually building the structure you can also import the entire structure or parts of it using a CSV or Excel file.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Before you start</strong></p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Do not start preparing the import before you have created all the required structure variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The organizational structure may have any number of levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When using Excel, you have to observe the following restrictions due to the specifications of the manufacturer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only the first sheet of the file will be processed. The maximum number of 256 columns and the maximum number of 65,000 rows should not be exceeded. If you require more columns or rows, choose another program and save the import file in CSV format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When using very large numbers as meta names, please note the following: Depending on the operating system, large numbers may be stored as<br>exponential numbers in Excel. When importing, EFS will adopt these exponential numbers as the meta names. You can easily avoid this problem by saving your Excel table in CSV format and then importing this CSV file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excel import is only possible when using files created or stored with Excel 97+. Excel files that have been created or stored with “Excel for Mac”, “Neo Office”, or “Numbers” cannot be imported as a matter of principle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The file format XLSX, newly introduced by Microsoft with Office 2007, is not supported by EFS. Please save your files as XLS files before starting the import process.</p>

<li>
<p>If there is no organizational structure yet, use the<strong> Import structure</strong> button. The illustrations in this chapter show such a complete import.</p>
</li>

<p>Otherwise, you need to locate the reference unit within the organizational structure, i.e., the unit under which to import the new structural portion. Open the<strong> Actions</strong> layer and click on the link <strong>Import structure</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are already in the detail view of the unit under which to import the new structural portion, open the <strong>Import Structure</strong> tab.</p>
