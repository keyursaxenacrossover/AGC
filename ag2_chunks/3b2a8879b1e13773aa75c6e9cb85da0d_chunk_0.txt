<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Information</h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">This guide provides comprehensive information on report ordering, including Ad Hoc Reports, Standard Reports, and Condition-based Reports. Each Report Definition fits all three types, so select based on project parameters. You can perform up to four order steps: selection of the focus unit (mandatory), order (mandatory), comparison groups (optional), and global filters (optional). The first step differs by report type, while the others are common. Settings under the sub-navigation field "Settings" influence these steps. It also covers report distribution methods and accessing reports through various platforms.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">There is hardly any difference between an <strong>Ad Hoc Report</strong> and a <strong>Standard Report</strong> when it comes to the page layout of the first order step: the selection of the <strong>Focus unit</strong>.  For both report types, the enterprise hierarchy that has been transferred to the organizational structure appears. The organizational structure can be expanded by clicking on the plus icon. For better handling, you can use a search function if your organizational structure has an unclear size.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">However, the following difference can be observed between an <strong>Ad Hoc Report </strong>and a <strong>Standard Report</strong>:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>Mass report ordering, the <strong>Standard Report</strong>, allows you to order a report for each Focus unit. Click on the units one after the other. Define a Focus unit for the individual report.</li>
<li>In the case of an <strong>Ad Hoc Report</strong>, the left pane does not simply list the units for which a report will be ordered but offers you the option of creating a virtual Focus unit. The legend, green doctoral hat, informs you about the available set operators.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="selection-of-the-focus-unit-ad-hoc-report" class="sc-lhVmIH iJLaKb wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Selection of the Focus unit (Ad Hoc Report)</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You select only one focus unit for the <strong>Ad Hoc Report</strong>, for which the report is then ordered. The organizational structure contains the unit that is to function as the focus unit. Then proceed to the next order step if you do not want to create the focus unit as a virtual focus unit.</p>

<li>A virtual Focus unit is made up of units taken from your organizational structure. First, enter a name for the new virtual unit, then click on the units one after the other and select the corresponding quantity operator from the drop-down list.</li>
<li>You combine several units into a virtual one by creating a set from the two uppermost units, from which a set is formed with the third unit, and so on.</li>
<li>Because you use one of the four operators for each set formation from two units, the sequence of the units already changes the resulting set.</li>
