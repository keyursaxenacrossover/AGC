 in the CMS area of portals, the new guides module can be accessed in the exterior view. The guide page module will provide a guide overview where all published guides are listed and can be initiated. The information that has been entered under the <strong>Additional information</strong> tab can be accessed by clicking the <strong>More Details</strong> link. You click on <strong>Start guide</strong> to start the guide setup, which is divided into three steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invitations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirmation</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first <strong>Questions</strong> you will be presented with an overview of the questions that will be asked to the individuals the guide will be sent to. Clicking <strong>Show questions</strong> will present the full list of guide questions. In addition, you will see the topics for this guide (that you had previously created under the Topics tab under the portals configuration). After this overview, which informs you about the key areas of the questionnaire, the second <strong>Invitations</strong> step follows.</p>
<p>From the invitations screen it is possible to send the guide to an existing group of people or create a new group from scratch. When decided who to send the guide to, you can use the search facility to search of individual panelists by name or e-mail address, or you can search for existing groups. If creating a new group from scratch this will be created as a personal managed public group. If you wish to send the guide to people not already registered in the system, you can simply type in their email address and the respondent will automatically be created as a panelist. Please note that when creating a new group from individual panelists and/or unregistered people, this cannot at this time be combined with existing groups.</p>

<p>Finally, during the <strong>Confirmation</strong> step you will receive an overview confirming the number of questions included in the guide, along with which group it will be sent to. From this screen it is also possible to write a short personal message to the recipients of the guide. Once you confirm your selection the invitation emails will be sent.</p>

<p><u>After starting a guide</u></p>
<p>To find out more information about the status of your guide, click on the <strong>View status</strong> button. In the overview page you can see which group was invited to take the survey, along with the current status of the survey (completed/running), and how many people have answered the survey. You also have the option to remind the group to participate, i.e. to send a reminder email, and to end the survey manually. Once the survey is complete, click the <strong>Results </strong>button to switch to the results dashboard. When a survey is complete, you can invite the group to conduct the survey again if desired.</p>

<h3 id="header-6">Modifications for the <em>Action Board</em>
</h3>
<p>A number of enhancements have been made to our recently launched <em>Action Board</em> page module.</p>
<p><u>E-mail templates for the </u><em><u>Action Board</u></em></p>
<p>The selection of e-mail templates that inform about the assignment of an action, the status change of an action, the sharing of an action and the commenting of an action can now be found in the module configuration of the<em> Action Board</em>. All e-mail templates are created under the <strong>Libraries</strong> tab. The e-mail templates should be created first in the main system <strong>Libraries</strong> area and they can then be selected in page module configuration. Please note that every additional <em>Action Board</em> that will be added to an individual portal will be actually a clone of the first board added so these settings do not need to be configured more than once.</p>

<p><u>The archive of the </u><em><u>Action Board</u></em></p>
<p>A new <strong>Show archived</strong> link will appear for any action board that has at least one ticket which has been archived. The column “Rating” has been added to the archive view, allowing you to see the average rating of an archived ticket. This way you can see at a glance which ticket has been rated high/low. In addition, the archived tickets can be sorted according to the average rating.</p>
