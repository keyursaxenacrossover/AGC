<em>Panel website</em>: Security Enhancements</h2>
<h3 id="header-29">Security question for change login details</h3>
<p>We have added an enhanced security feature that can be used with one or more of your panel websites.  This enhanced feature allows you to request an additional piece of information to be requested from a panellist in the event that they try to change the email address assigned to their account.  This additional security feature is NOT turned on by default, and must be requested by the customer.  Once the new security feature is enabled (upon request), your administrator(s) are able to select a master data variable as the additional piece of information the panellists needs to provide when trying to change with email address. As show in the screen shot below, the master data variable is selected, and a description that will be presented to the panellists is also added to the website.</p>
<p><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998156875410" alt="Security question new Feature.jpg"></p>
<p>Once enabled and configured on the individual websites <strong>Change login details</strong> module (as shown above), any panellist attempting to change their email address will need to also provide the additional master data variable as per the configuration of the website (as shown below).</p>
