Okta is using AWS cloud services to host their Identity solution. Other services might also be involved - also see <ac:link ac:card-appearance="inline"><ri:page ri:content-title="Legal" ri:version-at-save="3"></ri:page><ac:link-body>Legal</ac:link-body></ac:link> </p><p>Okta offers an EU cell for European companies. Data will be stored in Europe (information from Okta is that data is stored in Germany and Ireland) - also see <a href="https://www.okta.com/press-room/press-releases/okta-cements-its-commitment-to-emea-market-announces-eu-data-centre/">https://www.okta.com/press-room/press-releases/okta-cements-its-commitment-to-emea-market-announces-eu-data-centre/</a></p><p>Okta will store first name, last name and email address as well as possibly password and MFA details like a phone number of a user (this might change in future).</p><p>Identity data is still stored in the respective applications like EFS and Portals.</p><p></p><h3 id="header-5"><strong>How is security handled by Okta (our Identity Provider)?</strong></h3><p>Okta provides documentation about security related topics and certifications.</p><p>see <a href="https://www.okta.com/security/">https://www.okta.com/security/</a></p><p></p><h4 id="header-7"><strong>How is data transfer between the EFS installation (EFS-Admin, Portals) and our Identity Provider secured?</strong></h4><p>Data transferred from EFS to our Identity Provider will take place using the HTTPS protocol. An API token mechanism will be used to authorize requests to our Identity Provider.</p><p>Data transfer from our Identity Provider will also be secured using the HTTPS protocol. Communication in that direction will take place in the boundaries of OpenID Connect.</p><p></p><h4 id="header-8"><strong>How is data transfer between our Identity Provider and the client’s Identity Provider secured?</strong></h4><p>In the case of the communication with a client’s Identity Provider both sides have to technically take care of securing the communication. Our Identity Provider offers communication via HTTPS. During setup of the client’s Identity Provider we have to take care, that the communication fits our security needs.</p><p></p><h4 id="header-9"><strong>Is the Identity Provider always available?</strong></h4><p>Our Identity Provider guarantees availability of 99.9%. The documentation can be found here.</p><p><a href="https://www.okta.com/a-secure-reliable-service-you-can-trust/">https://www.okta.com/a-secure-reliable-service-you-can-trust/</a></p><p></p><h4 id="header-10"><strong>Is there a security monitoring in our Identity Provider? Who is in charge of performing it?</strong></h4><p></p><p></p><h4 id="header-11"><strong>What are the session (and token) lifetimes?</strong></h4><p>The session times can be found in the section sessions - see <ac:link ac:card-appearance="inline"><ri:page ri:content-title="Sessions" ri:version-at-save="4"></ri:page><ac:link-body>Sessions</ac:link-body></ac:link> </p><p>A more detailed explanation of the difference between the sessions can be found in <ac:link ac:card-appearance="inline"><ri:page ri:content-title="Sessions Explained" ri:version-at-save="1"></ri:page><ac:link-body>Sessions Explained</ac:link-body></ac:link> </p><p></p><h4 id="header-12"><strong>I previously used the high security mode in EFS - can I use that feature with IAM SSO?</strong></h4><p>The High security mode focuses on password policies, retry and lock processes and multi-factor authentication as well as ACLs, sessions and cookies.</p><p>Especially password-policies, multi-factor authentication, sessions and retry/lock processes do not effect the solution anymore when SSO is active. Hence most of the features in high-security mode might be irrelevant.</p><p>also see <ac:link ac:card-appearance="inline"><ri:page ri:content-title="MFA (Multi-Factor-Authentication)" ri:version-at-save="8"></ri:page><ac:link-body>MFA (Multi-Factor-Authentication)</ac:link-body></ac:link> and <ac:link ac:card-appearance="inline"><ri:page ri:content-title="Password Policy" ri:version-at-save="1"></ri:page><ac:link-body>Password Policy</ac:link-body></ac:link> </p><p></p><h4 id="header-13"><strong>How will a password reset happen?</strong></h4><p>see: Tivian Access with EFS and Portals</p><p></p><h4
