<h3 id="tile-layout-iii-report-definition-tile-on-the-selection-page" class="sc-lhVmIH iJLaKb"><strong>Tile layout III: Report Definition tile on the selection page</strong></h3>
<p>After selecting a report type, you have choosen a published Report Definition for ordering a report. This is done by clicking on the desired Report Definition tile on the selection page. This tile has only a very reduced layout.</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of the Report Definition</li>
<li>Language of the Report Definition</li>
<li>ID of the Report Definition</li>
<li>Short description of the Report Definition (directly on tile)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="export-import" class="sc-lhVmIH iJLaKb"><strong>Export &amp; Import</strong></h3>
<p>If you want to export a Report Definition, you use the corresponding command in the 3 point menu of the Report Definition tile. To do this, you must set the status to <strong>Published</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You define the location of your file by the means of the pop window.</li>
</ul>
<p>To import a Report Definition, you click on the button <strong>+ Import report definition</strong>. Again a pop up window opens and you select the desired file. It is worth knowing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The import is done including all the mappings and Collections as well as Dataspace Entities.</li>
<li>Uploading a template under the tab <strong>Libraries</strong> is not necessary.</li>
<li>You skip directly to the <strong>Report order</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="uploading-a-pptx-file" class="sc-lhVmIH iJLaKb"><strong>Uploading a PPTX file</strong></h3>
<p>To create a Report Definition, you have to upload a PPTX file as a template under the tab <strong>Libraries</strong>. You take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the configuration page you choose the tab <strong>Libraries</strong>.</li>
<li>You click on the button <strong>+ New Library</strong> and the library template tile appears.</li>
<li>You continue with <strong>+ New file (PPTX)</strong> and by the means of a pop up window you choose and upload the PPTX file prepared with <em>Tagging Tool</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>After uploading the desired file there are two ways to continue. The shorter of the two ways leads via the icon "Create report definition from template":</p>
<ul>
<li>The abbreviation offers you, apart from the time saving, a better handling.</li>
<li>A master slide is created from the upload file, which cannot be split into individual slides.</li>
<li>On the report definition page, you only work with the slide as a whole</li>
</ul>
<p>The second way, on the other hand, opens up the possibility of working with several foils. So you don't use the icon "Create report definition from template", but jump back to the library page by clicking the back button, change the tab and click on <strong>+ New Report Definition</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Report Definition tile appears. You quickly assign a name and another click takes you to the Report Definition overview page.</li>
</ul>
