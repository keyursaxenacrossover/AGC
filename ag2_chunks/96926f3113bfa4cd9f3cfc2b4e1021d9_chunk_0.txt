<h2 id="general_information">General Information</h2>
<p>Every installation has a technical domain (e.g., <strong>ab1234.customervoice360.com</strong>) with some exceptions for old installations. This generic domain is created automatically and cannot be manipulated. It always includes SSL and is provided at no extra cost to the customer.</p>
<h2 id="tivian_options">Tivian's Domain Offerings</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Custom domain</strong> from .customervoice360.com (e.g., bounty.customervoice360.com) with SSL included. Customer pays for this option.</li>
<li>
<strong>Second-Level-Domain or sub-domain</strong>, which can be from the customer or Tivian.
<ul>
<li>All domains now include SSL, automatically provisioned from Tivian</li>
<li>Customer pays for this option.</li>
<li>Support does NOT actively ask the customer for it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cname_info">CNAME Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>To find out who manages a domain, use <a href="http://whois.domaintools.com/">http://whois.domaintools.com/</a>. If you see <strong>NS1.OPST.DE</strong> or <strong>NS2.OPST.D</strong>E, it's likely managed by Tivian.</li>
<li>DNS propagation can be checked using: <a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net/">https://www.whatsmydns.net/</a>.</li>
<li>Extensive DNS information can be found in <a href="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20426284826642-The-world-of-DNS-Email-Certificates-and-how-it-relates-to-EFS-Aliases">The world of DNS, Email + Certificates and how it relates to EFS(-Aliases)</a>.</li>

<h2 id="01J3YWT03RW2V8F2110NRSMF6X">Tivian's SSL Offerings</h2>
<p>The provider we use to get SSL is <strong>Let's Encrypt</strong> and the certificates are automatically exchanged <strong>every 3 months.</strong> The customer does not need to inform us that the certificate needs to be exchanged.</p>
<p>There are four main scenarios when a customer requests an Alias, detailed below.</p>
<p>From a cost perspective, the first scenario is the least expensive one for Tivian, however, the last scenario is preferred, as it allows full ownership, and requiring the least customer communication.</p>
