justify">Configuring the text element editor</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Using the <strong>View</strong> function you will be able to edit the display of the language element editor.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>You can change the size of the input fields. Both the number of rows and the number of characters per row can be modified. By default, each input field has three rows and is 40 characters wide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can select languages for editing. By default, when you open the language element editor for the first time, it will display the first language that was created. For projects in three to four languages, it is advisable to display the text elements in all languages simultaneously. By contrast, for projects with a dozen or more languages, it may be more advisable not to show all the languages simultaneously but to edit the respective text elements successively or in groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you have completed the text elements on one questionnaire page, you can click on the <strong>Arrow</strong> icons in the top right corner of the window to navigate to the text elements of the previous or next questionnaire page.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="survey-messages" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Survey messages</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Similar to the language elements in the questionnaire, the survey messages of the project can be edited in several languages. To do so, click on the <strong>Survey messages </strong>menu item in the language editor.</p>
<h3 id="text-elements-from-the-library" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Text Elements from the Library</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In the top section of this dialog, in the “Which language do you want to fill with text elements from the library?” field, you can select the language in which you want to edit the survey messages. Select the desired language, and then confirm by clicking on <strong>Apply</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="survey-messages-1" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Survey messages</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If there is already a complete set of survey messages in the library, you can select it in the “Survey messages from library” field and accept by clicking on <strong>Apply</strong>.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In the “Survey messages of language x”, you can edit the survey messages:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>The left-hand column, titled “Element”, explains in which situation the respective survey message will be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The middle column contains the survey messages of the default language, i.e. the texts that you can also, as usual, view and enter under <strong>Project properties</strong> → <strong>Survey messages</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right-hand column shows the text elements in the target language. They can be changed as desired.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If the desired survey language should be coded with character sets other than the international character set UTF-8, then you should set up the appropriate character sets in the field “character sets”. More information on this topic, including a list of available character sets, can be found here. </p>
<h2 id="wildcards" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Wildcards</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If you are using the wildcard to incorporate text in multilingual projects, you can click on the <strong>Edit language elements </strong>button to insert and change the corresponding text elements in the various languages.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"> </p>
<h2 id="export-import" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Export / import</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The <strong>Export / Import </strong>function allows you to export text elements (i.e. question and help texts, fill-in instructions as well as question options) for external editing with MS Excel or with the translation software SDLX. You can thus make easy and concise changes to question categories and items. For example, you can rename (“relabel”) existing categories and items. This simplifies the translation of questionnaires significantly. However, no new categories, new items, or variables can be added. Importing text changes or translations into another project is not possible, either.</p>
