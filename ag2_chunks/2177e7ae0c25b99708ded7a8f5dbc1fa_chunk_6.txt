Export / Import </strong>function allows you to export text elements (i.e. question and help texts, fill-in instructions as well as question options) for external editing with MS Excel or with the translation software SDLX. You can thus make easy and concise changes to question categories and items. For example, you can rename (“relabel”) existing categories and items. This simplifies the translation of questionnaires significantly. However, no new categories, new items, or variables can be added. Importing text changes or translations into another project is not possible, either.</p>
