<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can export and if necessary, externally edit and reimport the organizational structure or parts thereof. This can be useful in various situations:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>You want to check the stored structures and/or numbers or relay these data to third parties for verification.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>You want to reuse parts of the organizational structure elsewhere in the same project. If, for example, two departments have the same or very similar<br>substructures, then you can export the completed substructure of the first department, adjust the names and values for the second department in the export file, and subsequently import it into this second department.</p>
