<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">As a moderator, you normally have a moderator or test account that allows you to use the same functions on the website as the panelists. For the most part, however, you will be working from the admin area: There are several moderation functions at your disposal.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Discussion posts should not be deleted or changed subsequently without good reason. Use your edit options sparingly and observe the netiquette.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Overview of the posts in a discussion</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">To view the existing posts in the admin area, click on the desired discussion in the section overview. Alternatively, you can also use the<strong> Show Posts</strong> icon.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The overview lists the topics and contents of all posts in the selected discussion. It also shows the names of the authors, date, importance, and release status.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Edit options</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Click on the Add Post button to open the dialog for creating a new post. The form is explained in detail in Table 14.7.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Click on the title of a post to open a list of its properties.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Via the icons in the “Actions” column you can edit individual posts:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<strong>Edit</strong>: This also opens the dialog for editing the properties of an existing post.</li>
<li>
<strong>Delete</strong>: The selected post will be deleted following a confirmation prompt.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">With the “Actions” checkbox and the drop-down list below the table, you can also apply various actions to several posts at once:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>Set release status to “approved” / “not checked” / “blocked”: Changes the release status of the selected posts.</li>
<li>Delete posts: The selected posts will be deleted following a confirmation prompt.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Properties of posts</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The table provides a detailed list of all the properties a post can have.</p>
