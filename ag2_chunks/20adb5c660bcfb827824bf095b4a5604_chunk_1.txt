<h2 id="additional_considerations">Additional Considerations</h2>
<p>Some tasks are not considered support tasks and should be handled by Professional Services (PS) or Customer Success Managers (CSM). These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation consulting</li>
<li>Consultation for simpler solutions</li>
<li>Moving projects from one installation to another</li>
<li>Account management tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>For tasks related to moving installations to their own database instance due to high workload and slow performance, additional technical costs and configuration efforts may be required. These should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p> </p>
