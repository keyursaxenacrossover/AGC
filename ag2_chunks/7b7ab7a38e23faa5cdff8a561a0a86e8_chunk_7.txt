<p>With drop-down lists, issues will be examined, for which there is only one possible correct answer.</p>

<p>It is not possible to create inside titles or several columns.</p>
<h4 id="entry-dialog-and-question-options">Entry dialog and question options</h4>
<p>The entry dialog for configuring a drop-down list is on the whole identical with the entry dialog for question type 111. However the type “Inside title” and the column “New column” are missing.</p>
<p>The question type-specific question options are also largely identical, only “Dynamic column text wrap” and “Wrap item text” are missing. Characteristic for question type 131 and the following question type 132 is that the select box can be placed within, in front of, or behind a text. To do so simply enter the desired text in the “Text around the select box” field and place the “%s” wildcard where you wish to insert the box into the text.</p>
<p>With a drop-down list of type 131, you should always use an answer option called “Please select” with code “0”. This will help you to track, during evaluation, whether or not a participant has answered the question.</p>
<p>The Mandatory function will only work in connection with question type 131 if an answer option called “Please select” with code “0” exists.</p>
<h3 id="open-response-list">Open response list</h3>
<p>Open response lists are used for questions to which there is only one possible correct answer. You have the option of setting any number of answer categories to be displayed.</p>

<h4 id="entry-dialog-and-question-options-1">Entry dialog and question options</h4>
<p>The entry dialog for configuring an open response list is on the whole identical to the entry dialog for question type 111. However, it is not possible to change the type of answer option: Only normal answer options are possible. Moreover, the column “new column” is not there.</p>
<p>The question type-specific question options are also largely identical, only “Dynamic column text wrap” and “Wrap item text” are missing. As with question type 131, you can also place the select box within, in front of, or behind the text.</p>
<h3 id="hotspot"><strong>Hotspot</strong></h3>
<p>The hotspot question type is very similar to the hotspot question type for matrix questions. The hotspot question type enables you to place answer options onto particular areas of a selected picture. Before uploading your picture, note that you should start by defining the necessary dimensions and scales.</p>
