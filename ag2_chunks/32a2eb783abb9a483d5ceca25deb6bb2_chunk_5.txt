 the wildcard entitled “label_footer_copyright”. In the standard panel, this wildcard contains the text “Tivian &amp;copy;”. If you call up a panel page, {$content.label_footer_copyright} is filled with this content, and “Tivian ©” is displayed. If you change the content of the wildcard, the copyright claim on the panel pages will also be changed.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The wildcards introduced in the previous chapter are used to output <em>predefined text elements</em>. However, the EFS Panel also has wildcards that can be used to dynamically output the personal data of panelists, for example. These wildcards are primarily used in Smarty templates. You can, however, also use them in page modules, to further personalize and localize your panel pages:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>Information that can be output includes
<ul>
<li>Localization information (e.g. date and time)</li>
<li>Panel information (e.g. panel name)</li>
<li>Participant data (only for logged-in panelists)</li>
<li>Master data (only for logged-in panelists)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which wildcards are available on a certain page depends on various criteria, such as the page modules used on the respective page or the login status of visitors. The following three tables contain wildcards that are available across the entire panel.</li>
<li>Page module input fields that allow the use of Smarty wildcards are marked accordingly with “Smarty code”.</li>
