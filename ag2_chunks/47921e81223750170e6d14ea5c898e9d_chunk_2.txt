<h3 id="header-28">End of support: Internet Explorer 11</h3>
<p>We would like to inform you that from Oct 1st 2021 we will no longer support Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11). This is in line with many organisations ending support of this legacy browser, including its creator Microsoft who stopped supporting IE 11 on Nov 30th 2020. After this date, you may have a degraded experience if using IE 11. New features will not be available and certain features may cease to work. While we expect much of the platform to remain operational using IE 11 in the short term, any issues encountered with this browser will no longer be fixed after this date. Many of our customers have been using IE 11 since 2013. At this time we operated in a much less sophisticated online environment. Since then, new standards and browsers have allowed for more innovative online experiences. We highly recommend that our customers update their default browser to a more modern browser to experience a faster, safer, more responsive and extensive set of features in our EFS platform.</p>
