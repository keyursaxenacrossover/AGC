<p>This article will help you create new panelists for the 360° Feedback by Lufthansa. This will most likely be because you have received a ticket stating something like "I need a login to 360° Feedback" or similar.</p>
<p><br>IMPORTANT: When you receive a request like this, NEVER add them as a user on Lufthansa installations. That would be a different request. Adding them as a user to the main installation could lead to a data breach.</p>

<p>As is visible in the screenshot, they will have a direct link to contact support when they can't log in using SSO or do not have an account yet. This will then create the ticket. </p>
