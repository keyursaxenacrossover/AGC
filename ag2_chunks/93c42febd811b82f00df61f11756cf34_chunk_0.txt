<h1 id="h_01J7B1ET75A8CWA0CKPYQR8DMT">Overview</h1>
<p>In DXI/EFS, the L2 scope usually spans over the below components:</p>
<ul>
<li>EFS Leadership</li>
<li>Email Services</li>
<li>New installations (blank, clone)</li>
<li>New Modules Activation</li>
<li>SMS Services</li>
<li>SSO - Identity Providers / OKTA</li>
<li>Text Analysis (Azure Cognitive Services)</li>
</ul>
<p>As an L2, you will also be interacting a lot with the service gateways and the backend MariaDB, along with the Platform Cockpit, Hurricane mail server and Grafana/Rancher. This article provides a blueprint of the must-reads in order to be prepped to successfully tackle DXI L2 tickets.</p>

<h2 id="h_01J7B29A2EK3XZV7Z7PDTM89VV">EFS Leadership</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is a special personalized survey type (Self-service 360 Leadership survey) for leaders to evaluate their performance and gather feedback from others. Includes an HR view for reviewing statistics​​.</li>
<li>This is recently being implemented/replaced using Guides in Portal configurations, and therefore in L2 Scope</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_01J7B29WAK191VAZPA9WVYTF2N">New installations/module activation</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is a type of request that you may encounter frequently, as customers (especially Kantar and Ipsos) will often require blank/clone installs.</li>
<li>The process consists of a multitude of steps that need to be taken, and until we somehow (at least partially automate it), it will be done against a checklist-style approach</li>
<li>The same checklist/guide can be used as well for module activation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_01J7B2FYGKTYD2JDN10DFAAK73">Service Gateways/Maria DB</h2>
<ul>
<li>Service gateways are machines to which you connect via SSH in order to view and change customer installations.</li>
<li>They are an integral part of supporting DXI as an L2 agent</li>
