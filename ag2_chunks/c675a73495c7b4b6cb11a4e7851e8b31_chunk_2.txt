<h3 id="faq_1" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Why is UTF-8 recommended for the EFS Survey?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">UTF-8 is recommended because it supports all characters from all languages, facilitates multilingual surveys, ensures uniform data storage, and allows for consistent coding of open-ended responses across different languages.</p>
<h3 id="faq_2" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Can I use multiple character sets in a single survey?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">While it's possible to use different character sets, it's generally recommended to use UTF-8 for all surveys, especially those that would otherwise require multiple character sets. This ensures consistency and simplifies data management.</p>
<h3 id="faq_3" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">How do I change the character set for my EFS Survey project?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can set the character set for your projects in the EFS Survey admin area. However, it's recommended to use UTF-8 unless you have a specific reason to use a different character set.</p> id="h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">FAQ</h1>
