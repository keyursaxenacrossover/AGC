<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Information</h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The Title Editor feature allows users to export, edit, and import titles for various elements in the questionnaire, streamlining the process of updating multiple titles at once. Even though the titles of pages, questions, and triggers are not displayed in the questionnaire, they do facilitate orientation in the questionnaire editor. Thus, these titles must occasionally be edited, e.g. to adjust them to a project-wide standard.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Instead of having to click on each element individually and change it step-by-step, <em>EFS</em> makes it possible to export the titles of pages, questions or triggers, edit them externally and then reimport them.</p>
