<h2 id="header-3">Enhancements to EFS Platform</h2>
<h3 id="header-5">Anti-virus and malware scanning for uploads in EFS</h3>
<p>With EFS 22.2 all customers benefit from ad-hoc anti-virus and malware scanning for all uploads within EFS. This applies to all uploads in the EFS Administration area, as well as the Upload and Audio question types in surveys or uploads in Portals. During an upload, the file is immediately scanned for malware, before being moved to its final destination within the EFS platform. If a malware is found, the file is immediately removed from the temporary storage and the user is notified that the upload was not successful. This approach ensures that at no point malware can be distributed through EFS.</p>
<h4 id="header-7">CSRF Tokens in EFS Admin</h4>
<p>The EFS Administration area is now protected with CSRF tokens from cross-site attacks without compromising on usability. While being reliably protected from cross-site request forgery attacks, administration users can continue working in concurrent browser tab sessions.</p>
