<h3 id="header-15">New and amended question types</h3>
<p><u>Slider</u></p>
<p>In the detail configuration of the <em>Slider</em> question type, check whether only the edge scale options should be displayed. When this setting is selected only the poles for the scale will be displayed. For example, a 5-scale question of 1,2,3,4 &amp; 5 would only display 1 and 5. This hides the other scale options, even if they have been defined.</p>
<p>This feature is available for R<em>esponsive Layout 2</em> and <em>3</em>.</p>

<p><u>Dynamic answer option</u></p>
<p>We have added a new <strong>Single response</strong> question type called <em>Dynamic answer option</em>. This question type will allow you to present a respondent with a single-response list that dynamically update based on responses given by previous respondents. This question type replies in the presence of a free text answer as part of the singleresponse list. For example, you may have a single-response question that asks a person their favorite brand of chocolate, with available answers: Cadbury, Lindt, Galaxy, Toblerone and Other. Against the other you have included a free text field (<em>Answer option + text</em>).</p>

<p>The new <em>Dynamic answer option</em> type can be configured so that if a specified number of respondents enter Hersheys as their favorite chocolate, this option is dynamically added to the list of possible responses for the next respondent to answer the survey. The following settings control this new question type:</p>
<p><strong>Treshold</strong> – this setting determines the number of respondents who need to have provided this new answer before it is added into the list of available answers. For example, we might decide that 10 people need to choose Hersheys before it is added to the list.</p>
<p><strong>Max amount of answer options</strong> – this setting limits the number of new options that can be dynamically added to the single-response list.</p>
<p><strong>Respect case sensitivity</strong> - this setting determines whether the case-sensitivity of a word produces a new answer option in each case.</p>
<p><strong>Alternating rows</strong> – this setting determines whether the newly added options are displayed in the order they were dynamically added to the list, or in a more randomized order.</p>
<p><u>Accordion matrix</u></p>
<p>This question type allows a more accessible display of matrix questions on mobile devices. In addition to making the question more accessible on mobile devices, the nature of the layout of this question types reduces the likelihood of people straight lining their answers. Along with the settings known for a matrix question type, you will find further settings in the detailed configuration that control the structure of the question in the questionnaire view. The information icon informs you in detail about the various options.</p>

<h3 id="header-16">New Trigger: Portal Action Trigger</h3>
<p>It is now possible to add a new trigger to your questionnaire: the portal action trigger. This trigger is used to create an action ticket on the action board. Actions created using this trigger are generated initially in the column "Inbox". After you have selected this trigger, first go to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab, where you assign a title and enter a short description for the trigger. In the <strong>Detail configuration</strong> it is possible to set both the title of an action, as well as specifying the person responsible for the action and the action creator. For the action title you can either enter a hard-coded title, or more typically you can enter the variable from which you wish to pull the title of the action. For thecreator and assignee fields you can either enter the appropriate variable in the <em>survey variable</em> setting, enter a specific email-address in the fallback setting.</p>
