</ul><p></p><h3 id="header-10">Features</h3><h4 id="header-12">Service Layer</h4><p>The EFS service layer currently could be used by a token or by a username and password mechanism. The username and password mechanism should be removed if possible. So no password are needed anymore</p><p>Adding OIDC flows it optional and can be done later.</p><p></p><h4 id="header-13">Authorization</h4><p>Authorization should stay in each solution. That means each solution will manage their own user rights and has to keep user records.</p><p></p><h4 id="header-14">Passwords</h4><p>A goals of the Identity Provider will be to remove all kinds of password from every solution other than the IdP itself.</p><p></p><h4 id="header-15">Federation / SSO</h4><p>Federation with other identity provider is a must. This is especially federating authentication. User creation will not be part of the first iteration. </p><p>It is not clear if that fits enough use cases. Especially the customized SSO solutions might be using user ingestions / just-in-time provisioning. This is at least a desired feature by many customers <ac:parameter ac:name="title">TO BE CLARIFIED</ac:parameter><ac:parameter ac:name="colour">Red</ac:parameter> </p><p></p><h4 id="header-16">User Data</h4><p>The user data should only consist of email-address and password - credential relevant data.</p><p>It is unclear if a username flow should be supported that either username or email-address could be used. <ac:parameter ac:name="title">to be clarified</ac:parameter><ac:parameter ac:name="colour">Red</ac:parameter> </p><p>It shall be possible to change the email address. Therefore after registration an identifier like the Identity Provider ID has to be stored an used. When an email address is changed then the other systems get updated as soon as the specific user logs in again. ( <ac:parameter ac:name="title">TO BE CLARIFIED</ac:parameter><ac:parameter ac:name="colour">Red</ac:parameter> also kafka might be used for that - meaning every system should be connected to kafka reading user-changed messages from it)</p><p>It is not 100% clear if that is possible and all users use an email address. It is at least a desired feature of some customers that more data is stored from their identity provider in combination with JIT. <ac:parameter ac:name="title">to be clarified</ac:parameter><ac:parameter ac:name="colour">Red</ac:parameter> </p><p>Each system should sync their users to the identity provider. Each system has to implement such a mechanism.</p><p>There should be a user registration for Portals, Panelwebsite and CXI. The Identity provider should just be one part of this handling the credentials only.</p><p>There must be a mechanism to finally/permanently delete users. That means if a user gets deleted from a system and unassigned from the identity provider it will get deleted entirely from the identity provider if the user is not assigned to any application anymore.</p><p></p><h4 id="header-17">Authentication mechanisms</h4><p>Multi Factor Authentication should be possible. It should at least support authenticator apps and email MFA.</p><p>A dashboard for users after they log in could be added. So that users that login without initially entering one of our application URLs will be forwarded to a dashboard that shows the applications they are assigned to. Then they can click on the application an get forwarded to it.</p><p>There should be an option to skip the screen of our identity provider when an external identity provider is used. That means a user will get directly forwarded from our identity provider to the external identity provider.</p><p>A passwordless authentication mechanism is not expected by our current customers and there might be too few customers to use or be able to use such a mechanism.</p><p>A reset password flow must be present.</p><p></p><h4 id="header-18">Emails</h4><p>Some customers are managing their users on their own. Therefore contact data should be adaptable in the emails.</p><p>Emails should always be send through the hurricane or a similar service. This is important for customers to keep their IP allow-listing for emails.</p><p>Design of the emails â†’ see customization below</p><p
