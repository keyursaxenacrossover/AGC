 special new feature in this section is the search using the creation date. You can now search for the period in which participants were created. But if you want to search for a specific date/day, the same date must be selected in both fields. A further possibility of the precise and fast participant search is the search for e-mail addresses. To do this, you can use the search for certain elements of an e-mail address in the upper left corner. For example, if you select <em>Ends with</em>, you can search for all e-mail addresses that end on a particular domain. The second search for e-mail addresses is located at the bottom right and allows you to search for several e-mail addresses at the same time by entering these addresses one below the other in the free text field. In the extended search of Personalized Surveys, you can also use the free text field <strong>Code</strong> to search for several codes at the same time.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In the "Fields without index" area, you can search for participant variables that do not have an index in the database. A search in the "Fields without index" area therefore takes much longer than a search in the upper area. But if you have a participant variable from the lower area searched particularly frequently, this variable field can be provided with an index in the database. For this purpose, please contact our support team.</p>

<h3 id="search-multiple-e-mail-addresses" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Search Multiple E-mail Addresses</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Using the “Search multiple e-mail addresses” function in the extended search, you can simultaneously select a large number of participants via their e-mail addresses. This is useful if, for example, you wish to set a large number of participants whose invitation emails have been bounced back to disposition code 15 (not available).</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Just copy the e-mail addresses of the participants you are searching for into the entry field. In doing so, limit each line to just one e-mail address. After that, confirm by clicking on <strong>Search</strong>. The participants will then be located.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">There are different shareware tools, which can be used for extracting e-mail addresses from bounced e-mails. For example, you can download the eMail Bounce Handler from <a href="http://www.maxprog.com/EmailBounceHandler.html" data-card-appearance="inline">http://www.maxprog.com/EmailBounceHandler.html</a> .</p>

<h2 id="display-functions" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Display Functions</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">As the participant administration usually contains a large number of extensive participant data records, only selected data are normally displayed in the overview list. However, several functions enable you to specify which participant data and how many participants per page will be displayed.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>The links labeled &gt; (Next page) and &lt; (Previous page) allow you to scroll forward and back through the list of participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clicking on a column title allows you to sort all participant data by the content of the respective column. For example, clicking on “Participant” will sort all participants alphabetically by their names.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-view-button" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The View Button</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">By clicking on the <strong>View</strong> button you can display a dialog that allows you to specify whether the various table columns are to be shown or hidden. You can also change the number of rows per page. After you have confirmed by clicking on <strong>Submit</strong> the table will be expanded accordingly.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">To display the “User ID” you need the <em>export-with_lfdn </em>right. If you would like to obtain this right, please contact our support team.</p>
