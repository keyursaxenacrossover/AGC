<p data-renderer-start-pos="3450">No. There is a difference between the authentication (who am I?) and the authorization/access (what am I allowed to do?) in the current solution. The Identity Provider will only verify that an identity belongs to the respective user. The access right for that specific user are still managed by every Application.</p>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="3765">Hence every user that logs in at our Identity Provider can tell every Tivian application their respective identity but will not be able to access every application.</p>

<p data-renderer-start-pos="4053">The customer’s Identity Provider belongs to the customer. Therefore we do not have (and we should never have) any access to that provider changing anything. Security on the side of the Identity Provider is fully Managed by the customer.</p>

<p data-renderer-start-pos="4656">The password the user provided at Okta will be stored at Okta. The user should never be asked for that password if this user is an Identity Provider user. But in that case either the configuration in EFS or Okta are not correct.</p>
