<h1 id="h_01J9XK6102N7TFSXD9XK4ZYZD9">Overview</h1>
<p>There are customers with which we have contractual obligations for disallowing access (Bank of America), or there are simply customers that don't want their instance to be accessed from anywhere. </p>
<p>Depending on the instance setup, the behavior can be different:</p>
<ol>
<li>The DXi login page can show up when accessing the instance URL, but disallows login unless the originating IP is on the whitelist (Requests from this IP address are not allowed.) - this is standard DXi functionality<br><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21920885652242" width="312" height="122">
</li>
<li>The DXi login page comes up as blank - this means that the IP Whitelisting is done through an additional layer, using <strong>custom routing plugin</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This article will take you over the steps for configuring an instance IP whitelist.</p>
<h1 id="h_01J9XK66H10H7JGRMA1BX6SCV5">Process</h1>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><strong>No matter what method you use, it is very important to remember adding the Trilogy VPN IP address to the IP whitelist, so that we are able to access the customer instance for troubleshooting: <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><em>52.6.229.154</em></span>. </strong></div>
<h2 id="h_01J9XKV6A11DY21EYX93JPHF6N">Method 1 (Via UI)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Login to the required instance; if you are getting a blank screen, you will either need to:
<ol>
<li>Use the RA-VPN to access it (<a href="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20434985085586" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discover XI (DXI) Agent Access Guide</a>) OR</li>
<li>Approach it from the service gateway (<a href="#01J9XMP1T0V88AT3WQX6F289HF">method 2</a>)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Navigate to <strong>System &gt;&gt; Options &gt;&gt; Platform Cockpit &gt;&gt; [root only] System Configuration</strong>
</li>
<li>Search for "<strong>range</strong>"; below is the default value for <code>admin_login_ip_range</code> allowing access from all IP's<br><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21921098778002" width="486" height="103"><br><br>
</li>
<li>Modify the value of <code>admin_login_ip_range</code> according to the customer's request</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="01J9XMP1T0V88AT3WQX6F289HF">Method 2 (Via Service Gateways)</h2>
<p>This method can be approached if you are more comfortable via CLI OR if you accidentally get locked out while setting up the IP Whitelist:</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to the service gateway hosting the customer instance (<a href="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/21139518716562" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Access and Work with DXI Service Gateways</a>)</li>
<li>Run <code>i {{TECHNICAL_NAME}}</code>
</li>
<li>Run <code>helpersEfsGetConfiguration range</code>; this is how the below config will look like:<br><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21921098783890" width="548" height="78">
</li>
<li>In order to change the IP whitelist, you need to simply run:<br><code>helpersEfsChangeConfig admin_login_ip_range IP_ADDRESS_TO_BE_WHITELISTED</code>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h_01J9XN7WG2V7XAQH94TPSZBP91">Method 3 (custom routing plugin) </h2>
<p>This method complements the other 2, meaning that if a customer requests that their instance page loads up only for the whitelisted IP addresses, and shows blank page for any other IP address, you need to go through <strong>method 1 or method 2</strong>, and then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the below set of commands <strong>line by line</strong>, which will check if the <code>plugin.inc.php</code> file exists, and if it doesn't, it will create it<br>
<p><code>i {{TECHNICALNAME}}</code></p>
<p><code>[ -f "/nfs/installations/{{TECHNICALNAME}}/nfs/opst/{{TECHNICALNAME}}.customervoice360.com/htdocs/custom/routing/plugin.inc.php" ] &amp;&amp; echo "File exists."</code></p>
<p><code>mkdir -p custom/routing &amp;&amp; cd custom/routing &amp;&amp; vi plugin.inc.php</code></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>If the file doesn't exist</strong>, add the following code in the <code>plugin.inc.php
