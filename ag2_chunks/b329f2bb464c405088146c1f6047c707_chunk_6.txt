<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Please note that participant administration variables of the “text field” type and project variables that refer to text fields are preallocated differently:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Participant variables that are imported by the project manager and not filled by the participant are set to “0”.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Please proceed as follows:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Switch to the <strong>Participant variables</strong> menu, and click on Edit to open the dialog for the desired variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then click on<strong> Save</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Please note that renamings comprising several steps must be performed in individual steps, i.e. if you wish to recode code 1 to code 2 and code 2 to code 3, you must first recode code 2 to code 3 and then code 1 to code 2.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>The recoding dialog will be opened. Here, you must re-confirm the recodings explicitly.</p>
