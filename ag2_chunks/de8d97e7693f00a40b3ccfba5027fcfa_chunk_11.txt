 and the library template tile appears.</li>
<li>You continue with <strong>+ New file (PPTX)</strong> and by the means of a pop up window you choose and upload the PPTX file prepared with <em>Tagging Tool</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>After uploading the desired file there are two ways to continue. The shorter of the two ways leads via the icon "Create report definition from template":</p>
<ul>
<li>The abbreviation offers you, apart from the time saving, a better handling.</li>
<li>A master slide is created from the upload file, which cannot be split into individual slides.</li>
<li>On the report definition page, you only work with the slide as a whole</li>
</ul>
<p>The second way, on the other hand, opens up the possibility of working with several foils. So you don't use the icon "Create report definition from template", but jump back to the library page by clicking the back button, change the tab and click on <strong>+ New Report Definition</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Report Definition tile appears. You quickly assign a name and another click takes you to the Report Definition overview page.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="h_01HGKSMPRSQGX3YJXQXBXWP8YM" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">What is the difference between the three report types?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Ad hoc reports allow for a virtual unit as the focus unit. Standard reports are used for ordering individualized reports for multiple focus units simultaneously. Condition-based reports allow selection of multiple focus units using property filters.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HGKSMPRS7YJXQD1YJXQXBXWP" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">How do I activate the Loop mode in a report?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">To activate Loop mode, tag the table or chart with a Loop_Mode tag, setting the value to either "Rows" or "Columns". Then, in the Report Manager, a slide switch will appear to activate the Loop mode.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HGKSMPRS3YJXQD1YJXQXBXWP" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Can I modify a published Report Definition?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">No, you cannot modify a Report Definition when its status is set to "Published" or "Draft". To make changes, you must set the status to "Edit".</p>
