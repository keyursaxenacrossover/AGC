<p>You can also use the structure variables you created in EFS-Employee as filters to select the focus unit in the first step of the <strong>Condition-based Report</strong>.</p>
<p>You navigate in EFS:</p>
<p>[<em>selected project</em>] → <em>Org Processor</em> → <em>Configuration</em> → <em>Structure variables</em> → <em>Create variable</em></p>
<p>A newly created variable is imported into the Report Manager after every update of the Data Voyager.</p>

<h2 id="the-second-order-step-selection-of-the-comparison-groups" class="sc-lhVmIH iJLaKb wysiwyg-text-align-left"><strong>The second order step: Selection of the comparison groups</strong></h2>
<p>Once a focus unit has been selected, edit the comparison group selection by specifying members. Each member of the comparison group can also be created as a virtual comparison unit. Perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the button <strong>Edit selection</strong>.</li>
<li>You edit the name of your comparison group by clicking on the pen icon.</li>
<li>You select a new comparison unit of the organizational structure that is to be the first member of the comparison group.</li>
<li>To add a new comparison unit to your comparison group, you click on <strong>+ New virtual focus unit</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Otherwise, you create a virtual comparison unit directly.</li>
<li>You do not specify the sequence of the units that you want to include in your comparison group until you do so. In the mapping on the sub-navigation field <strong>Pages</strong>, you select a comparison unit from the comparison group, but this is only a placeholder. Now you define the actual participant. From the organizational structure, select the unit that is used for the placeholder. Make sure that the unit gets the desired position.</li>
<li>The comparison units are determined from top to bottom. This corresponds to the representation of the inspector on the sub-navigation field Pages. The unit elements of the configured comparison unit are counted from 1 to x.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next to the pencil, you will find the filter icon: the funnel, which allows you to define filter conditions for the members of the comparison group.
<ul>
<li>A modal opens for the filter conditions, which helps you to set the filters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The funnel is highlighted as soon as a unit has been fitted with a filter.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="comparison-group-filters"><strong>Comparison group filters</strong></h3>
<p>Clicking on the filter icon, the funnel opens the modal. You add a new filter condition by clicking on the button. The filter conditions are linked to each other by the logical OR, while the filter groups are linked by the logical AND.</p>
<ul>
<li>The filter syntax, which is also used in the mapping area of the sub-navigation field <strong>Pages</strong>, does not change.</li>
<li>Within a filter group, you define a filter using the left Select Box, which is specified with the right one.</li>
<li>A filter group corresponds to a variable, so that the filters cannot be changed within a group.</li>
<li>The filters apply to the member of the comparison group, which can also be a virtual comparison unit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Virtual comparion units</strong></p>
<p>You create virtual comparison units, as you create a virtual focus unit. For the virtual comparison unit, you also activate filters.</p>

<li>You create each member of the comparison group as a virtual comparison unit.</li>
<li>You create virtual comparison units with set operators: union, intersections, difference and/or symmetrical difference.</li>
<li>You activate a filter separately for each virtual comparison unit in the comparison group.</li>
<li>Filtering is performed in addition to the filters set in the Report Definition.</li>
