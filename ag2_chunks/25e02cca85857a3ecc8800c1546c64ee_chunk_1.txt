<p>You can now use #wildcards#, e.g. #v_1#, as a value in standard filters of a survey, allowing users to compare answers of a question with a given answer of a different question without the need to use the alternative or LUA filter.</p>

<h3 id="header-8">Layout templates for question types</h3>
<p>EFS Survey now supports editing of templates for all question types in Responsive Layout 3. Until now, it was only possible to edit some selected templates, with this release, it is now possible to introduce small modifications through the Pro-Editor to any question type, without the need to use the question type editor.</p>
<p>In a project, by going to the layout editor and selecting the Pro editor, a new template section “Additional Question-Type templates” is available, with a list of all templates used by the various question types. Click on edit on any of the templates, to customise it.</p>

<h3 id="header-9">IP Restrictions in Survey Projects</h3>
<p>It is now possible to change the mode of the IP access control in Project properties &gt; Login options for project types AN, PE, ES and MSF. Previously the list of IPs functioned as an allow list, now it is also possible to block an IP range or individual IPs through the select box. A mixed mode, where some IPs are allowed and some blocked from access is not possible.</p>

<h3 id="header-14">Domain mapping for Portals and Panel Websites</h3>
<p>The existing feature domain mapping has been enhanced to support Portals. It is now possible to specify the redirect for the default root-website of a domain (e.g. <a href="https://qubie.app/">https://qubie.app/</a>) to a specific portal, just like it was possible to specify a language version of a website previously. The feature now is also located in People &gt; Panel configuration, since not all installations have the older Website module activated.</p>
<p>This allows easier hosting and management of multiple portals, with different domains on a single EFS installation.</p>

<h3 id="header-19">New guide type: Topic</h3>
