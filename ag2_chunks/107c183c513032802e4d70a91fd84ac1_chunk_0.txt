<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Information</h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The key element of <em>EFS Employee</em> is the <em>Org Processor</em>, which allows you to map your corporate structure in the software and to supplement it with all kinds of data required in the survey (e.g., position, and address data of the employees). Thus all these data become available for the survey process, i.e., it is possible, for example, to present your employees with questionnaires that are tailored to their respective role, or you can evaluate the survey results separately for each individual department. The Org Processor is activated by default in new employee surveys. It can be found in the <strong>Projects</strong> → {Selected project} → <strong>Org Processor</strong> menu. This guide explains how to use the Org Processor effectively, from setting up the organizational structure to managing users and configuring various options.</p>

<h2 id="organizational-structure" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Organizational structure</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">When you open the <em>Org Processor</em>, the <strong>Organizational Structure</strong> tab will be displayed automatically. It shows the organizational structure with the key characteristics of the units and forms the starting point for all subsequent work.</p>

<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">

<p>By summing up the values for online participants and/or paper-pencil questionnaires and comparing them with the preset values you can easily check whether the stored data are correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By clicking a unit in the organizational structure you can access all the data stored for this unit, i.e., properties such as name or process status, contacts, preset value, participant data, or requisition notes concerning paper-pencil questionnaires.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The data in the overview are updated every five minutes. If necessary, use the Update Participant Numbers icon to trigger an update manually.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Changing the view</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Above the organizational structure you will find four buttons with which you can change the display:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p><strong>Expand all</strong>: All branches of the organizational structure are opened entirely so that you can see every unit. In large structures, this action requires considerable time: The auto-expansion feature described below presents a time-saving alternative. For very large structures, i.e. structures with 1,000 or more units, both features are hidden for performance reasons. Use the search function to find the desired units in such large structures!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collapse all</strong>: All branches of the organizational structure are closed entirely. Only the topmost unit of the hierarchy remains visible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Activate</strong> / <strong>Deactivate auto-expansion</strong>: This function makes sure that the respective branch is always completely expanded upon clicking. You no longer have to click every single node to see the whole branch in its entirety. This function is disabled again by clicking <strong>Deactivate auto-expansion</strong>. Please mind that auto-expansion is not available for very large structures, i.e. structures with 1,000 or more units, for performance reasons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>View</strong>: Clicking this button will open a dialog where you can activate or deactivate various table columns (except for the permanent columns “Short form of unit name” and “Actions”). After you have confirmed by clicking on <strong>Save settings</strong> the table will be modified accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Opening other structure views</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If several structure views are used, you will find a drop-down list above the menu where you can switch back and forth between the different structure views. As soon as you change the setting, the desired structure view will be displayed.</p>
