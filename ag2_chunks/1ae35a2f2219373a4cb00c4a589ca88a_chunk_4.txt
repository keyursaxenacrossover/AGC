<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-renderer-start-pos="6690">You now know the basics for automating processes in the <em data-renderer-mark="true">People</em> module. In the following, we will present you with 3 scenarios in which these are applied in practice.</p>

<h2 id="Scenario-1" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-renderer-start-pos="6858"><strong data-renderer-mark="true">Scenario 1</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-renderer-start-pos="6870">In the first scenario that we will present to you, we assume the following use case:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-renderer-start-pos="6956">You are a larger company and have a correspondingly large employee panel. New employees are added to this panel. The following processes are to be automated as part of the onboarding process after an employee has been added: The employee receives a welcome email on the day they are added to the panel. This is phase 1. Two months later, the same employee automatically receives a survey in which they are asked about the progress of their onboarding process. This is phase 2. Four months later, another survey should be sent automatically at the end of the onboarding process. This is phase 3.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-renderer-start-pos="7552">In order for all these processes to be carried out automatically, you need to complete several tasks in preparation. We have already covered some of these in the previous points under <a class="cc-1rn59kg" title="https://qbdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/edit-v2/4149608460?draftShareId=77f2e92c-cc13-4bb3-abc2-2cbc316317bb#Basis-for-Automation" href="#:~:text=Index%20(PCI)%20Management-,Automation%20Basics,-The%20basis%20for" data-testid="link-with-safety" data-renderer-mark="true">Automation Basics</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Create-groups" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-renderer-start-pos="7756"><strong data-renderer-mark="true">Create groups</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-renderer-start-pos="7771">You have already created the "New employees" group. However, we now need two more groups, into which new panelists will be added after 2 months on the job and after an additional 4 months. Therefore, create the groups "New employees – phase 2" and "New employees – phase 3" as described under <a class="cc-1rn59kg" title="https://qbdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/edit-v2/4149608460?draftShareId=77f2e92c-cc13-4bb3-abc2-2cbc316317bb#Groups" href="#:~:text=or%20adapted%20accordingly.-,Groups,-Groups%2C%20or%20so" data-testid="link-with-safety" data-renderer-mark="true">Groups</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Create-Email-Templates" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-renderer-start-pos="8070"><strong data-renderer-mark="true">Create Email Templates</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-renderer-start-pos="8094">We have already created the email template for the welcome email that employees receive after being added to the panel. Now create two email templates for the survey invitation that employees should receive after 2 and 6 months respectively. Enter #code_complete# as the placeholder for the link to the survey. Below you can see two examples of what the emails could look like.<img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21014859706514"></p>
