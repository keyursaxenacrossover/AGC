 the person responsible. This choice can also be revoked, although every improvement requires a responsible person.</p>
<h3 id="adding-categories" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Adding categories</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">For each improvement, you add up to three categories, which you can create in the CMS area of portals on the sub-navigation field Content under the tab Topics. The colors selected for the categories appear on the Improvement Ticket. Subcategories that you also create in the CMS area of Portals are not supported currently.</p>
<h3 id="the-comment-function" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>The comment function</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In the detail view, you comment on an improvement. A profile picture, name, and surname are displayed. By clicking on the name or profile picture you will be forwarded to the profile. The time of the comment is also displayed. Besides the possibility to enter a text, paste a video link, and upload a photo, comments can be answered. If you have activated it, you will be notified by e-mail or push notification when an improvement has been commented on.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation-of-an-improvement" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Evaluation of an improvement</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">After moving an improvement ticket into the column "Done", you can rate it by clicking on the button "Evaluate" visible only in this column. In the detail view, you will now find a scale from 1 to 5 on which you can rate the improvement. The rating must be confirmed. Once a user has rated a ticket, it can no longer be removed from the "Done" column.</p>
<h3 id="archiving-an-improvement" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Archiving an improvement</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">An improvement is archived either automatically after all users have rated it, or manually by clicking on "Archive" under the More option. Tickets that have been archived can only be commented on. Other functions are no longer available. Improvements cannot be reactivated either. The archived improvements can be hidden or displayed. If you decide to display archived improvements, the board view changes, and an archive table is displayed with the column headings "Title", "Person Responsible" and "Shared". You determine how many improvements per page are listed in the table. You use the information icon to jump to the detailed view.</p>

Once you have added this new module, you can open the module configuration by clicking on the dropdown arrow. Under the configuration area, you can select the panel group to which those individuals invited to participate in a Guide will be added. The additional profile settings allow you to specify two additional pieces of profile information that will be shown to the portal users when they are searching for those individuals they would like to send a Guide. These additional pieces of information simply enhance the panelist search, making it easier to find individuals. Once you have completed the basic page module configurations, all additional configuration options can be accessed from the new menu sub-navigation option </span><strong>Guides</strong><span style="color: #091e42;">. Once you access the new </span><strong>Guides</strong><span style="color: #091e42;"> sub-navigation, you will be presented with the following six tabs:</span></p>
