<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The report should begin with an executive summary that explains the most important results. This section should capture attention and provide an overview, with a more detailed analysis following later in the report.</p>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>In this section, present interesting conclusions from your analysis, even if they are not direct answers to the survey's primary purpose. However, always prioritize quick answers to relevant conclusions that affect the main purpose of the survey.</p>
<h2 id="measures">Measures</h2>
<p>Based on the conclusions drawn from the results, describe the different measures you recommend for implementation.</p>
<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<p>Include other findings from the survey that are not highly significant or directly related to recommended measures in an appendix. This ensures comprehensive documentation of results for those who want a thorough review.</p>
<h2 id="visual-presentation">Visual Presentation of the Results</h2>
<p>Include graphs in the appendix that provide information on the sample composition, such as distribution by gender, division, or region. Include the number of participants and responses for each question. Focus on clarity and communicability when choosing colors and diagram types.</p>
