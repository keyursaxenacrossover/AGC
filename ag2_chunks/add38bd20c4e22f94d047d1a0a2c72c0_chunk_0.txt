<p>Master Data Allocation is a crucial process in survey management that involves transferring project variables to master data within the database. This guide explains how to plan, manage, and execute master data transfers effectively.</p>

<p>The master data collected during master data surveys and panel surveys must be transferred from the survey to their proper location within the database by means of a special operation called master data transfer. Which project variables are to be transferred to which master data in this process is defined in the <strong>Master data allocation</strong> menu.</p>

<p>The functional scope in brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the overview table, you will find all allocations of project variables to master data at a glance. You can also check the characteristics via this table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can download the allocations in order to check them in detail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The appropriate master data for all project variables of a survey can be created automatically. This is done via the option “Create and allocate master data”. This is an effective way to create the master data survey for a new panel, for example. It takes only a few clicks to create the appropriate master data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also automatically create individual master data items, if required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The master data overview of the panel tells you in which panels the master data have already ben allocated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use loops in master data and panel surveys. However, data collected in those loops cannot be used as master data. They cannot be transferred to the master data via master data transfer.</p>
<h2 id="planning-the-transfer-of-master-data"><strong>Planning the transfer of master data</strong></h2>
<p>The following guiding questions will help you plan the master data transfer for a new panel or master data survey.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Which project variables are to be transferred to which master data?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the required master data already exist, what is their data type and range? Does the format of the participant entries in the survey have to be secured or modified by plausibility checks, recodings or other means?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the master data do not yet exist, which variable types and value ranges are they supposed to have? If you only need the usually required data types “integer” and “text”, then automatic creation would be the better option. For the data types “date”, “date/time” or “yes/no” and for specific size ranges the appropriate master data should be created manually.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the survey have any characteristics that may be relevant for the master data transfer?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is multiple participation possible?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have the collected variables already been collected previously via the registration form, the “change data” form, the master data survey or another project? Whether a master data item is also referenced by another project can be seen in the column “Survey allocations” of the master data overview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the master data were collected previously, do you want to use the existing values to preset answers? The feature “Transfer master data values to survey variables” allows such a presetting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the missing values “NULL” and “-77” to be included in the master data transfer, or shall the transfer only take place if the questions have actually been answered?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If, for example, the master data have already been filled in during registration, it may not make sense to overwrite these values with missing values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall the master data transfer start automatically immediately after completing the interviews, or shall it be triggered manually? If it is to be triggered manually by the moderator, when and for which disposition codes does this make sense?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In master data surveys, the data are always transferred automatically as soon as a panelist reaches the
