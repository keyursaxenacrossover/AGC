<h2 id="general_approach">General Approach to Support Services</h2>
<p>The approach to support services is based on how support is defined in contracts. It is important to have a clear definition of what is included in standard support without additional costs. Customers need to be informed that some support tasks will incur additional charges. A grace period may be implemented to avoid any discussions regarding unexpected costs.</p>
