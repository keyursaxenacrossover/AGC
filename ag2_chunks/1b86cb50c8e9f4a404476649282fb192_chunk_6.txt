<p>Serves to identify an answer option for single response lists and matrix questions. An overview of all encodings is provided in the codebook.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can edit the encoding. However, you should never do this while the survey is in progress because otherwise, the encoded information will be lost or it will no longer be possible to assign it correctly. Filters and other functions that are based on codes can also be damaged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When defining codes in matrix questions, please note that code “0” is disabled for scale items, except for question types 351, 361, and 364. Code “0” is normally used for question types 361 and 364 to generate the “Please select” scale cha- characteristic: This allows you to track whether participants have responded to the question.</p>

<p>The answer text may have up to 10,000 characters. But please keep in mind that overlong texts may negatively affect the appearance of the question.</p>
