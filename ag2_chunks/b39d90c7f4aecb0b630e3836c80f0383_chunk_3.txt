<h3 id="header-21">Feedback Assistant: new dashboard functions</h3>
<p>Use the corresponding icon on the survey tile to access the dashboard of the Feedback Assistant survey. There you have the functions of e-mail forwarding and PDF and PNG download to share the result data even more easily. If you choose “Forward via email”, the standard mail client opens. All participants of the survey have already been included in the recipient line.</p>
<h3 id="header-22">Feedback Assistant: Manager Participation</h3>
<p>You control the manager's participation in a Feedback Assistant survey by specifying in a personalized project under the item "template configuration" whether the manager never or always participates in a survey or whether he or she can decide about his or her participation.</p>

<p>As soon as the participant is selected during the creation of a Feedback Assistant survey, there is a slide switch on the right-hand side, whose control option is based on the definition under “Template configuration”. If you have decided upon never or always, the switch cannot be moved: The manager either participates in all surveys or not. As soon as you choose decided by the manager, the button will be unlocked, so that the manager can decide on his participation by means of the sliding switch.</p>
<h3 id="header-23">UX optimization of the Feedback Assistant</h3>
<p>The setup of a Feedback assistant survey and the sending of invitations has been streamlined to enable an even smoother workflow. By selecting exactly one survey template and one e-mail template in the “Template Configuration”, it is possible to skip the step "Template" on the way to the Feedback Assistant survey automatically and the selection of an e-mail template is no longer necessary. The invitation mail will also be sent immediately after saving, if you have chosen to send invitations manually in the step "Invitations". In this case, shipping does not have to be triggered by the envelope icon on the survey tile.</p>
<h3 id="header-24">A new module: Portal Invitation</h3>
<p>From now on you have the new module Portal Invitation, which is used to invite people to a portal as well as to add them to a circle. To do this, you make the following settings for module page integration: You assign a heading, select an e-mail template and a panel group to which the persons to be invited are to be<br>added by using the drop-down list. In addition, a limit is set for the maximum number of invitations that can be sent per user.</p>
<p><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998485762450" alt="14c4a1df-3e60-4ae1-ab65-924b292bcde4"></p>
<p>After successful integration, the Portal Invitation module can be accessed from the portal's exterior view. Clicking on the “Invite users” button opens a modal, inviting future users by entering their e-mail address, first name and surname.</p>
<p>If you want to invite several users at the same time, you can proceed in two ways: Either you click on "add another", whereby further user invitations can be issued by entering the e-mail address, first name and last name, or you click on “add multiple at once”.</p>
<p>In this case, you type in a free text field the first and last name and the e-mail address, whereby not only the first name, the last name and the e-mail address are separated by a semicolon, but two semicolons are set for the listing after each user to be invited.</p>
<p>In addition, a circle can be selected in advance to which users who accept the invitation will be added. After the invitations have been sent, a table is created with all users who have received an invitation. It can be sorted by the column headers of the header. As long as an invitation has not been accepted, the status remains “Invited”. As soon as the user clicks on the link sent with the invitation e-mail and clicks on "Register" after filling in the registration form, the status changes and the user is logged in to the portal.</p>

<h3 id="header-25">Displaying a page once after the first login</h3>
<p>On the sub-navigation field “Settings” under the tab “Page connections” you have the possibility to define a page in the CMS area of Portals, which can be used as a welcome page after the first login. On this page you can, for example, list notes for the next steps.</p>
<h3 id="header-26">Wildcards for the Text and Multimedia module of Portals</h3>
<p>The module Text and Multimedia, which is known from the module integration of portals, now has placeholders (#Wildcard#) in the editor that allow you to display user-related profile information and master data in the external view.</p>
