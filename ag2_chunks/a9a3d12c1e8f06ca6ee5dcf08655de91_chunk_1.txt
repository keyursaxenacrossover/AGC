 sync ?</strong></p><p>The portal sync is completely independent of the running business on the EFS installation (and its users). The sync should happen before activating Tivian Access to ensure that all portal installation will work and be accessible.</p><p>The sync will take only a few seconds so it can be done shortly before, but we recommend to leave a time buffer in case the sync will not be successful.</p><h4 id="header-7"><strong>What steps are required for the user sync ?</strong></h4><p>The user sync consists of two phases.<br><strong>Phase 1</strong> is creating the users in Okta. A script will take all existing users from an EFS installation (EFS Admins or Panelists) and push them via API calls to Okta.</p><p><strong>Phase 2</strong> is activating the users in Okta. A script will activate the previously created users via API. This will trigger Okta to send out an activation mail to the users. Once the users will follow the instructions in the email, they will be able to setup a new password in Okta so they can log in.</p><p>Phase 1 should be done before activating Tivian Access on an installation, since it can be very time consuming. Phase 2 should happen either shortly before activating Tivian Access or right after. Without the activation, users will not be able to login to the EFS installation but if they are activated to early, users will most likely be confused by the mail from Okta because they can not login to any application after setting up their account.</p><p>Communication with the client will be they key, since they user experience with the sync is highly dependant on the client setup within Tivian</p><h4 id="header-8"><strong>How long does a user migration take ?</strong></h4><p>This depends highly on the amount of users in the installation(s) and if they are using their company’s Identity Provider (since those users don’t need to be synced)<strong>.</strong></p><p>Syncing a few (&lt;100) EFS Admin users should not take more than a few seconds.</p><p>If a million panelist users needs to be synced, this could possibly take hours.</p><p>The limiting factor to this will be the Okta API rate limit which is set to 600 user creations a minute (shared across all Okta applications)</p><h4 id="header-9"><strong>When should I start the user migration ?</strong></h4><p>To answer this you have to think about the following:</p><ul>
<li><p>During migration users receive an activation mail from Okta. Do the users expect such an email ? When can they start using their Okta account (Tivian Access is completely activated on the EFS installation)</p></li>
<li><p>Activating Tivian Access without the user sync (and assuming no Identity Provider is used for federation) will have the effect that users can not sign in to EFS anymore.</p></li>
</ul><p><strong>To conclude</strong>: Migration has to happen before the activation of Tivian Access (for all users which are not using their company’s Identity Provider).
