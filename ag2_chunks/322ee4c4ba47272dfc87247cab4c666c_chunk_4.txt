 can now invite offline users. This does require some setup and configuration before you get started:</p>
<p>To declare panelists as offline participants, first set the new master data m_offlineusers to 1 (= yes) in the Panelist administration of the People module. In Guides (in Portals) select the appropriate template under the <strong>E-mail Settings</strong> tab of and configure the code voucher under the <strong>Offline Participants</strong> tab. These voucher are then sent by email as a PDF to the person who initiated the survey in Guides. They can also be downloaded from the Guide Status page in Portals. The intention is for the person who initiates the Guide to then print off the vouchers, and distributed them in person to the offline participants. The vouchers include a unique participation code, a QR code that links to the survey, the first and last name of the participant and the survey URL.</p>

<p>Offline participants are then free to access the survey, either directly using the URL or by scanning the QR code with their own mobile devices. They will be prompted to enter their participant code before completing the survey.</p>
