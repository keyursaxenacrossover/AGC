<h2 id="login_process">The Login Process</h2>
<p>The EFS administration area is accessed through a personal login, typically found at<strong> http://www.your-domain.com/www/</strong> or via a secure https connection for new installations. The admin area login is protected by the area_www ACL right. Access requires a valid account name and password with write permissions.</p>
<h3 id="forgot_password">Forgot your Password</h3>
<p>If you forget your password or account name, automated help functions are available on the login screen. Follow the on-screen instructions after clicking the special link provided.</p>
<p>Staff accounts expire with the renting contract date and will be deactivated automatically. Contact support if your account has expired.</p>
<p>EFS has brute force protection, deactivating accounts after six false password attempts for 30 minutes. Use the login screen help if you've forgotten your password.</p>
<h3 id="security_question">Security Question</h3>
<p>The password recovery function is protected by a security question, which is set up during the first login. Users can select from suggested questions or create their own, along with providing an answer. You can subsequently edit the security question in the System → Users → Own account menu → User data.</p>
<h3 id="security_criteria">Security Criteria</h3>
<p>Passwords must meet specific criteria, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum 6 characters</li>
<li>Characters from at least two of these groups: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, other ASCII characters</li>
<li>No spaces allowed</li>
<li>Password expiration every 100 days</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Simultaneous use of an EFS Admin account is not possible. Simultaneous use of an EFS Admin account will invalidate the previous login.</p>
<h2 id="browser_support">Browser Support</h2>
<p>EFS supports the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari (on macOS). Internet Explorer 11 support ended on October 1st, 2021. Mobile support is limited to basic survey functionality on iOS 11+ and Android 5.0+. The admin area doesn't support mobile devices/browsers. </p>
