<h3 id="header-9">Template configuration</h3>
<p>As it is now possible to make projects available through portals as either Feedback Assistant templates, or Guides, we have updated the <strong>Template Configuration</strong> area available under <strong>Project Properties</strong>. There is now a “Usage” property where you can identify which of the two modules <em>Guides</em> or <em>Feedback Assistant</em>, you want to make the template configuration for. It is possible to configure a project so that it is available both through our new Guides module and our Feedback Assistant module.</p>
<h3 id="header-10">Miscellaneous: Sidebar, Feedback-Bubble, Profile</h3>
<p>We have made it much easier for your portals users to provide quick feedback regarding their experience. Rather than relying on them to email you their feedback, you can now add a simple feedback bubble to the exterior view of the portal. This icon will appear on the bottom-left of each page of your portal, and upon clicking the icon the user will be taken to a new browser window and will be asked to complete a feedback survey that you have configured. You activate this feature in the sub-navigation <strong>Settings</strong> under the <strong>General settings</strong> tab, where you tick the option "Show feedback bubble". An available survey link will appear that can be replaced.</p>

<p><em>Portals</em> has a new navigation option. In addition to our existing tab, bar and user profile navigation, it is now possible to have a left-hand sidebar navigation on your portals. You configure this in the sub-navigation <strong>Navigation</strong> under the <strong>Sidebar</strong> tab. The sidebar is configured by simply adding the portal pages you would like to be accessible from the sidebar, in the order you would like them to appear. If you would like the sidebar to always remain visible, select the tickable option "Menu always visible". Once ticked, portals users will not be able to hide the sidebar navigation and it will remain visible at all times.</p>

<p>Under the new <strong>Settings</strong> tab, which you will find in your<strong> Profile</strong> area of the portal, you can now change your password, select your preferred language and activate the translation mode.</p>
<h2 id="header-12">Survey</h2>
<h3 id="header-14">Global categories</h3>
<p>We have a new <strong>Categories</strong> area available within our <strong>Libraries</strong>. <strong>Libraries</strong> are accessible from the main top-right <strong>System</strong> menu. Categories allow you to create themes within your surveys/projects and can also be assigned to tickets within our <em>Action Board</em> portals module.</p>

<p>Once in the <strong>Categories</strong> area you can add a category using <strong>+ Category</strong>. The configuration area opens, where you assign an individual meta name, select a color and deliver a translation that is optional. The meta name is mandatory and limited to 3 to 30 characters. Umlauts cannot be used. If you want to delete a category, you must make sure that all connections have been disconnected. By clicking on the edit icon, you can find out which connections are available for a category. Questions can be assigned to a category in the questionnaire editor and action tickets in the detail view. Before you can delete a category, however, you must undo each individual connection for which the trashcan icon is available in the <strong>library</strong> area.</p>

<h3 id="header-15">New and amended question types</h3>
<p><u>Slider</u></p>
<p>In the detail configuration of the <em>Slider</em> question type, check whether only the edge scale options should be displayed. When this setting is selected only the poles for the scale will be displayed. For example, a 5-scale question of 1,2,3,4 &amp; 5 would only display 1 and 5. This hides the other scale options, even if they have been defined.</p>
<p>This feature is available for R<em>esponsive Layout 2</em> and <em>3</em>.</p>

<p><u>Dynamic answer option</u></p>
<p>We have added a new <strong>Single response</strong> question type called <em>Dynamic answer option</em>. This question type will allow you to present a respondent with a single-response list that dynamically update based on responses given by previous respondents. This question type replies in the presence of a free text answer as part of the singleresponse
