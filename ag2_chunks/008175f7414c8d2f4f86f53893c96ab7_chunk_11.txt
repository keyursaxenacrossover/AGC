<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Under the <strong>Basic information</strong> tab, you can provide a title for your newly added guide along with entering a description and uploading an image that will be visible to the portal’s users accessing the guide. The Title, description, and picture are displayed in the guide overview area. The <strong>Additional Information</strong> tab allows you to provide more details about the specific guide you are configuring, to help the end-user determine if this is the correct guide (template) that they would like to use. In this area, you can provide more detailed descriptions of what the guide will measure and how it will operate. In addition to text descriptions, you can also add photos, videos, and links using our new editor, to provide comprehensive details about your new guide. Under the <strong>Topics</strong> tab, you can associate your new guide with specific topics. These topics must be created first in the <strong>Topics</strong> area of the <strong>Content</strong> section of portals. You select a topic by ticking it and you can choose to display the topics alphabetically in either ascending or descending order. You use the <strong>Questionnaire</strong> tab to select the specific survey that this guide will send out. You can choose from the list of questionnaires that you previously created in our <em>Project</em> module. To appear in the list, the project must have been set to <strong>Active</strong>. Only projects of the type <em>Personalized Survey</em> are available for <em>Guides</em>. The <strong>E-Mail templates</strong> tab is used to select the relevant mail templates that will be used in the guide workflow. You can select templates for the invitation, reminder, and result e-mails.</p>
<h3 id="settings-1" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Settings</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><span style="color: #091e42;">Under the </span><strong>Settings</strong><span style="color: #091e42;"> tab, you can set the participation period for which the guide will remain active for respondents along with the minimum number of participants for the guide. The minimum number of participants setting allows you to maintain confidentiality and only make results available once a minimum number of people have responded to the guide. In this area, you also define which portal role is allowed to start the guide whether a reminder e-mail should be sent, and when. You define whether the e-mails should always be sent to all participants or whether participants who have already completed the survey will not receive any further reminder e-mails. Therefore you deactivate the option “Send reminder mails to all participants” by setting the slide switch to </span><strong>OFF</strong><span style="color: #091e42;">. The manager participation setting controls whether the sender of the guide should be allowed to also respond, and a further setting controls whether the initiator of the guide should be able to send to respondents by simply entering an email address. Lastly, there are settings to determine whether a results e-mail should be sent, and where this results e-mail should direct the recipient to. You will see additional settings whereby you can specify a particular page within the portal and can select a </span><em>MySight</em><span style="color: #091e42;"> project, a workbook, and a view. These settings can direct people to a different dashboard than the one associated with the guide.</span></p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><span style="color: #091e42;"><span style="color: #091e42;">Once you have finished configuring your guide, you can make the guide available via your portal by publishing it.</span></span></p>
