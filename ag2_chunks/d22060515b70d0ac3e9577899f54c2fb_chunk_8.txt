<h3 id="identifying-cleaned-data-in-the-export-record" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Identifying cleaned data in the export record</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The export record provides information if an individual record was cleaned: It is stored in the variable cleaned (labeling in the SPSS export record: “datacleaning”) which can have the following properties:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>0 = uncleaned data records and records of incomplete interviews which are excluded from the cleaning process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 = cleaned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 = checked but did not require cleaning</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="delete-data" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Delete data</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Result data can be deleted selectively, i.e. the value of a specific variable for all participants (e.g. an e-mail address determined in the course of the survey) will be completely removed from the records. This makes it possible, for example, to anonymize data later on.</p>

<h3 id="faq-1" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">What is the purpose of the Field Report?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The Field Report provides essential information about the study's progress, including statistical data, access statistics, drop-out rates, and quota statistics. It helps monitor the survey's performance and identify any issues during the field phase.</p>
<h3 id="faq-2" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">How can I restrict the Online Statistics?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can restrict Online Statistics by selecting specific disposition codes or variable characteristics in the configuration options. This allows you to focus on particular subsets of your data for analysis.</p>
<h3 id="faq-3" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">What is Quality Correction and how does it work?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Quality Correction is a feature that helps identify low-quality responses based on participants' response times and behavior. It calculates a quality index for each participant, which can be used to filter out potentially unreliable data from your analysis.</p>
<h3 id="faq-4" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">How does Data Cleaning improve survey data quality?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Data Cleaning automatically removes irrelevant data caused by participants using the "Back" button and changing their responses to filter questions. This ensures that the final dataset only contains valid and consistent responses, improving the overall quality of your survey results.</p>The Field Report provides essential information about the study's progress, including statistical data, access statistics, drop-out rates, and quota statistics.
