<h3 id="h_01J3HWA6R95N6CCMWTRNHVZWFY">Preventing URL Manipulations (Referer Checking)</h3>
<p>In High Security Mode, EFS checks if URLs in the admin area are accessed internally to prevent manipulation or external access. Manually changed URLs cause the browser to stop transmitting a referer. Note that anonymity and security tools removing referers will prevent use in High Security Mode. From EFS 7.0, referer checks are not performed for users with Microsoft Internet Explorer due to its handling of http referers.</p>
