assigned from the identity provider it will get deleted entirely from the identity provider if the user is not assigned to any application anymore.</p><p></p><h4 id="header-17">Authentication mechanisms</h4><p>Multi Factor Authentication should be possible. It should at least support authenticator apps and email MFA.</p><p>A dashboard for users after they log in could be added. So that users that login without initially entering one of our application URLs will be forwarded to a dashboard that shows the applications they are assigned to. Then they can click on the application an get forwarded to it.</p><p>There should be an option to skip the screen of our identity provider when an external identity provider is used. That means a user will get directly forwarded from our identity provider to the external identity provider.</p><p>A passwordless authentication mechanism is not expected by our current customers and there might be too few customers to use or be able to use such a mechanism.</p><p>A reset password flow must be present.</p><p></p><h4 id="header-18">Emails</h4><p>Some customers are managing their users on their own. Therefore contact data should be adaptable in the emails.</p><p>Emails should always be send through the hurricane or a similar service. This is important for customers to keep their IP allow-listing for emails.</p><p>Design of the emails → see customization below</p><p><u>Emails in scope are:</u></p><ul>
<li><p>Password reset (containing a one-time link)</p></li>
<li><p>User activation (also containing a one-time link)</p></li>
<li><p>Registration (email confirmation?!)</p></li>
<li><p>…this has to be detailed out - most likely there are more emails depending on the flow <ac:parameter ac:name="title">to be clarified</ac:parameter><ac:parameter ac:name="colour">Red</ac:parameter> </p></li>
</ul><p></p><h4 id="header-19">Customization</h4><p>A configurable customization of all screens has to be possible. This will be colors of the tenant and a logo. The same is true for emails.</p><p>It would be best if an embedding of the Identity Provider screens as iframe would be possible. Especially the login screen and the registration screen. This would enable designs around the login login screen etc.</p><p>It has to be clarified if allowing iframes is a problem from a security perspective when it comes to the login screen etc. <ac:parameter ac:name="title">to be clarified</ac:parameter><ac:parameter ac:name="colour">Red</ac:parameter> </p><p></p><h4 id="header-20">Root User</h4><p>No local root user should be kept in the applications. Users get the access right of an admin or a qbonly admin. This means there are no credentials kept in the applications.</p><p>Admin users should be forced to use at least multi-factor authentication.</p><p></p><h4 id="header-21">Maintenance</h4><p>The must be a sufficient set of maintenance scripts (or a UI) for the support. Those should especially align with our typical flows instead of generic identity provider functions. That could be something like a script to setup an installation (this would create an application and multiple kinds of groups).</p><p>We should ask support what would be nice to have there. <ac:parameter ac:name="title">to be clarified</ac:parameter><ac:parameter ac:name="colour">Red</ac:parameter> </p><p>A self-registration for customers might be a helpful addition so that customers can test their identity provider setup without our involvement. (like testing if every field is at the correct place etc.) <ac:parameter ac:name="title">to be clarified</ac:parameter><ac:parameter ac:name="colour">Red</ac:parameter> </p><p></p><h4 id="header-22">Groups and Applications/Clients</h4><p>Each customer/tenant should get a group with all users of that tenant. That group should contain the tenant wide policies and configuration.</p><p>There will be a group for a specific application containing the members of that application.</p><p>Applications spread accross multiple modules. The following applications should exist:</p><ul>
<li><p>Tivian Analytics [one for all]</p></li>
<li><p>Dashboard (check if that could be one together with Tivian Analytics?! <ac:parameter ac:name="title">to be clarified</ac:parameter><ac:parameter ac:name="colour">Red</ac:parameter> ) [one for all]</p></li>
<li><p>CXI [one for all]</p></li>
<li><p>EFS including Portals and Panelwebsite [one per installation]</p></li>
<li><p>Datavoyager (clarify if reportmanager is included or should get it’s own application <ac:parameter ac:name="title">to be clarified</ac:parameter><ac:parameter ac:name="colour">Red</ac:parameter> ) [one per installation]</p></li>
</ul><p></p><h4 id="header-23">Policies</h4><p>There should be policies in place for different flows and use cases.</p><ul>
<li><p>Password policy: Managing what passwords are allowed (should be individual per tenant)</p></li>
<li><p>MFA policy: Managing when to enroll and request what kind of MFA (should be indiviual per tenant)</p></li
