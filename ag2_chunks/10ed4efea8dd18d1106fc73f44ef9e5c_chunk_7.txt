<h2 id="h_01J4V332RC699PMC6PCX8AF5JR">Portal Module</h2>
<p>Portals offer new ways to interact with your panelists, forming a community and collecting feedback in various ways, may it be through discussions between panelists or by taking part in surveys directly from a portal‘s interface. Qualification of survey results or the joint development of survey topics are easily feasible for each survey project.</p>
<p><strong><em>Please note:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>To enable the portal module, you must have the people module activated. However, the people module can be enabled without the portal module.</em></li>
<li><em>You won't need to set up a new portal for customers—Professional Services handles that. Any issues related to the portal's Look and Feel should be directed to Professional Services. Customer Support assists with core feature issues (e.g., login problems, navigation) and how-to questions.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>For practice, we'll create a portal in our test instance and explore the options.</p>
