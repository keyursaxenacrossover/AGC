<p>One of the features of EFS is to sent SMS to users. This could especially happen in case of invitations.</p>
<p>On this page snailmail and jobmaker are part of the EFS software. This is not entirely true from a deployment perspective but good enough for this page.</p>

<p>From a top-level view the picture below shows how email sending works.</p>
<p><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20591453803154" alt="Runtime View - SMS.png"></p>
<p>Email and SMS are output channel for communication. In some of the cases they could both be used. Therefore they are handled similarly internally in EFS.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>EFS software</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>creates SMS from templates and puts them in an email table</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>next to that an email procedure is created in another table - one procedure can have multiple emails</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the templates are filled when sending forwarding emails to the email server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there are two mechanism to actually send emails:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ad-hoc: An SMS is sent directly when sending is triggered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>snailmail: SMS are put in the email table and processed by a cron-job called snailmail that periodically loads un-sent emails and forwards them to the email server</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tyntec SMS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Tyntec HTTP API is used to send SMS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a reply EFS get an identifier of the SMS procedure at Tyntec</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tyntec sends the SMS to the enduser</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EFS software</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>stores the Tyntec procedure ID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A task in the cron-job Jobmaker will periodically request the delivery status of the stored Tyntec procedure IDs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In case there is an update the respective entry in the EFS database will be updated</p>
</li>
</ul>
