<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can check in the panelist’s detail view, whether the e-mail was sent. To do so, click on the <strong>Contact history</strong> button on the <strong>Contacts</strong> tab: The sought-after e-mail can be found in the “system mail” section.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><em>Information: </em>A panelist has lost the voucher mail and you want to send the voucher code again?

<h3 id="sending-vouchers-automatically" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Sending Vouchers Automatically</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Optionally, you can have vouchers automatically issued by the system. This feature reduces your and your colleagues’ workload. However, it also means that voucher requests are no longer monitored by humans. You should therefore weigh up how high the risk of abuse is for your panel. If you choose to use this feature, test the configuration very carefully before activating it and regularly check the accuracy of payments made.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">To activate automatic dispatch, click on the “Automatically send voucher confirmation mail” checkbox when creating the bonus type.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><em>Information: </em>The option <strong>Offer vouchers only from lists that still have unused voucher codes</strong> in the <strong>BONUS LIST AND REDEMPTION</strong> module is activated by default. If all vouchers of a list have already been redeemed, the bonus types using this voucher list will no longer be displayed. However, if the option is not activated, these bonus types will continue to be displayed and panelists can still redeem their points. In this case, however, the automatic dispatch of the voucher is not triggered. Instead, the redeemed voucher is displayed in the <strong>People</strong> module under <strong>Incentive management &gt; Bonus system &gt; Issuing of vouchers</strong> – just as if no automatic voucher dispatch had been configured. A red traffic light symbol and the number 0 are displayed in the <strong>Available</strong> column indicating that the voucher cannot be issued. The <strong>Encash</strong> action will only be available again once you upload new voucher codes.</p>
