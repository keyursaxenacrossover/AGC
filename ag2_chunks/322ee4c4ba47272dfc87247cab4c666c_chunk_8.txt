<p><u>Sentiment Analysis Trigger</u></p>
<p>The sentiment analysis trigger categorizes open text feedback as negative, positive or neutral. The usage of this trigger is similar to the key phrase extraction trigger, start by selecting a sentiment from the trigger behavior of the custom trigger. Again, we recommend setting up an execution condition to check that feedback has been provided in your source variable.</p>
<p>This trigger uses up to two variables (custom or from a 911 user-defined question type) to store the result of the analysis. The first variable of type short text or text will contain the categorization (negative, positive or neutral) and the optional second variable of type float will store the sentiment score provided by the service. This will be a value between 0 and 1, where 0 is the lowest sentiment strength, and 1 is the highest.</p>
