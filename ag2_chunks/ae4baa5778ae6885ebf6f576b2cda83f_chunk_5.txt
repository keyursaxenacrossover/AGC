> module, under the Contracts sub-menu. These groups have been updated so that they no longer need to be owned by the person who created the group. It is now possible to change ownership by selecting one of the other group participants as future owner by accessing the <em>group list</em> view and then changing the group owner. The owner can edit or delete the group.</p>

<h3 id="header-8">Multi language portals and a new role: Translation Manager</h3>
<p>A new development that will delight many of our global customers is the additional of multi-language support for our portals. In the past if you wished to have a portal available in multiple languages, you would need to create a new portal for each of the languages you wished to make available to your users. This created a significant administration overhead and did not offer the best experience to your portal users. It is now possible to have one single portal and make it available in multiple languages.</p>
<p>To add a new language to an existing or new portal you need to go to the subnavigation <strong>Settings</strong>, and then go to the <strong>Languages</strong> section.</p>

<p>In the languages section you are presented with a tabular display with the column headings: language, code, translation status, import/export, default language, publishers and delete. You click on <strong>+ Add new language</strong> to add a new language to the portal. Enter the name of the language and then select the corresponding ISO code. There is no limit to the number of languages that can be added to a portal. Once the new languages have been saved, the import and export functions will be activated.</p>
<p>The default language for the portal is selected by checking this setting against the appropriate language, and the <strong>Publish</strong> slide switch will activate a language to make it available to portal users.</p>
<p>In the lower area of the screen, all phrases used in a portal are listed in a table. You can search for individual phrases and add or modify translations there. To view the different languages translations, simply select the language from the <strong>Translation for</strong> drop-down list. Changes can then be made to the translations for that language and then saved against the portal, and where appropriate these can be exported and imported into another portal. The fields of untranslated phrases remain empty.</p>

<p>On all pages with "public" access rights, the language select is available. The pages will display a globe icon in the top right-hand corner of the screen, allowing the user to change the language to any of those that are currently published on the portal. Once the user is logged into the portal, they can edit their user profile and select one of the published portal languages under the new <strong>Settings</strong> tab. Any Portals user that has the role <strong>Translation Manager</strong> will also have access to the new translator mode feature, also accessible under Settings tab.</p>

<p>This feature can be activated by the slide switch, and once activated the user will be able to see the phrase ID alongside the translated text. This feature makes it easier for the translation owner to identify specific phrases that require translation and then they can access these and update them in the portals CMS.</p>

<h3 id="header-9">Template configuration</h3>
<p>As it is now possible to make projects available through portals as either Feedback Assistant templates, or Guides, we have updated the <strong>Template Configuration</strong> area available under <strong>Project Properties</strong>. There is now a “Usage” property where you can identify which of the two modules <em>Guides</em> or <em>Feedback Assistant</em>, you want to make the template configuration for. It is possible to configure a project so that it is available both through our new Guides module and our Feedback Assistant module.</p>
<h3 id="header-10">Miscellaneous: Sidebar, Feedback-Bubble, Profile</h3>
<p>We have made it much easier for your portals users to provide quick feedback regarding their experience. Rather than relying on them to email you their feedback, you can now add a simple feedback bubble to the exterior view of the portal. This icon will appear on the bottom-left of each page of your portal, and upon clicking the icon the user will be taken to a new browser window and will be asked to complete a feedback survey that you have configured. You activate this feature in the sub-navigation <strong>Settings</strong> under the <strong>General settings</strong> tab, where you tick the option "Show feedback bubble". An available survey link will appear that can be replaced.</p>
