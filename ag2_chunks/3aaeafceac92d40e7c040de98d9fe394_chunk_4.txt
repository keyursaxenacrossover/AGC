<p>One possible way of inviting participants is to publish a link to the survey on a website or in a newsletter or an e-mail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With EFS, you will find it particularly easy to communicate the URL of your survey - not only online and through e-mail, but also in QR code via print media, for example. In anonymous projects, you will find the field “QR code” in the<strong> Survey menu</strong> in the “Distribution” section: clicking on the <strong>Display</strong> button opens a pop-up window containing the QR code of the survey URL. In order to save the QR code image to your PC, right-click the image and select the option “Save image to...”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Features for sharing links in the most influential social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn und XING) are located in the Survey menu in the <strong>Distribution</strong> section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your survey is intended to appear in a pop-up window you can make <em>EFS</em> create the requisite code with a click on the<strong> Get pop-up code</strong> button. Copy and paste the code into your web page. If you are not familiar with HTML, please ask a web designer or developer to help.</p>
