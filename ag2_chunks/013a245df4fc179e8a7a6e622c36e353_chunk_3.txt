 On this tab you can use radio buttons to choose between <strong>MySight Dashboard</strong> and <strong>Dashboard Configuration</strong>. If you choose <strong>MySight Dashboard</strong>, the familiar MySight configuration guide for your guide results will be displayed. If you select <strong>Dashboard Configuration</strong>, the available dashboard templates are displayed. Depending on the template, you have a wide range of settings.</p>

<p><em>EFS</em> has also been improved. The search function of the participant list has been improved. The preview for e-mail templates has been revised, so that creating these templates can now be done in no time at all. Among other new features, the pages of the questionnaire can now be marked as finished. </p>
<h3 id="header-23"><strong>New Search Function for the Participant List</strong></h3>
<p>The search function of the participant list has been revised, so that now large amounts of participants can be searched with a minimum of time. The search is divided into two sections: "Fields with index" and "Fields without index".</p>
<p><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998054084114" alt="Search 1.png"></p>
<p>In the section "Fields with Index" you can, for example, search for participants according to the disposition code. A special new feature in this section is the search using the creation date. You can now search for the period in which participants were created. But  if you want to search for a specific date/day, the same date must be selected in both fields. A further possibility of the precise and fast participant search is the search for e-mail addresses. To do this, you can use the search for certain elements of an e-mail address in the upper left corner. For example, if you select <em>Ends with</em>, you can search for all e-mail addresses that end on a particular domain. The second search for e-mail addresses is located at the bottom right and allows you to search for several e-mail addresses at the same time by entering these addresses one below the other in the free text field.</p>

<p>In the "Fields without index" area, you can search for participant variables that do not have an index in the database. A search in the "Fields without index" area therefore takes much longer than a search in the upper area. But if you have a participant variable from the lower area searched particularly frequently, this variable field can be provided with an index in the database. For this purpose, please contact our support team.</p>

<p>This function is deactivated by default. To enable the new search feature, please contact our support team.</p>
<h3 id="header-24"><strong>New Preview for E-mail Templates</strong></h3>
<p>The creation of e-mail templates is very complex, which is why the preview function makes your work much easier. Up to now this preview function was only partially available. With the new preview for e-mail templates you are not only allowed to choose different views (desktop, tablet or mobile phone), but you also get a preview of how the detailed e-mail will look like. You can enter values for the placeholders as a test. Also attached files can be displayed.</p>
<p><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998040694546" alt="E-Mail Preview.png"></p>
<p>Sending a test e-mail is also possible. The e-mail address of the current user is used as the sender address for this e-mail. You can also send the e-mail to different candidates by entering names separated by a semicolon. If one of the e-mail addresses is incorrect, the entire process is cancelled and an error message is displayed informing you which of the e-mail addresses is incorrect. In addition, you can switch between the different language versions (if different language versions are available).</p>
<h3 id="header-25"><strong>ID for E-mail Templates</strong></h3>
<p>Until now, it was not possible to save information about which e-mail template was used to create an e-mail. From now on each e-mail will be provided with an ID generated by the system, which will be listed in the mail report table in the <em>Mail Template</em> column. The ID also acts as a link, allowing you to access the template you are using.</p>

<h3 id="header-26"><strong>Early Complete</strong></h3>
<p>From now on, you can mark the pages of your questionnaire with a special indicator, so that e.g. participants who have answered these questionnaire pages will receive the disposition code <em>completed</em> at the end of the participation period or the deadline set by you. To activate this feature, open the <strong>Project properties</strong> of your PE project and check the option "Early complete support".</p>
