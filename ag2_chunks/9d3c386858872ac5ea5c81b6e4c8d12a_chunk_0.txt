<p>Factor enrollment is a process in Okta that takes care of collecting Multi Factor information from users accessing applications. Factor enrollment defines which users have to provide Multi Factor data.</p><p></p><p><strong>Keep in mind that the factor enrollment does not mean that MFA is active. MFA will be activated using a Sign-On Policy see </strong><ac:link ac:card-appearance="inline"><ri:page ri:content-title="Sign-On Policy" ri:version-at-save="1"></ri:page><ac:link-body>Sign-On Policy</ac:link-body></ac:link><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><table data-layout="default"><tbody>

<p>There are three different cases:</p>
