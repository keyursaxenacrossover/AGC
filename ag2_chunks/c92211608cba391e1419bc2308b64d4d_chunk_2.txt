>The <em>Ideation Guide</em> workflow is divided into three phases. In the first phase, the starting phase, you define the category or categories in which suggestions for improvements can be made, select participants and send out invitations.</p>
<p><strong>Second phase: Ideation phase</strong></p>
<p>After that the collection of suggestions will start. A survey must be completed. The phase can be started via the e-mail invitation or the guide status page.</p>

<p>You will also find some information about your <em>Ideation Guide</em>: the category, the start date of the guide, the phase the guide is in, the date when the phase will end, and the participations. The buttons allows you to participate in the current phase. Using the three-point menu, you can also participate in the current phase, view the participants and end the current phase.</p>
<p><strong>Third phase: Voting phase</strong></p>
<p>After completing the second phase, the <em>Ideation Guide</em> Questionnaire, the third phase will start, voting on the suggestions received.</p>

<p>Participants can tick off the suggestions. The suggestions with the most votes will be forwarded to the <em>Action Board</em>. A ticket will be created.</p>
<h2 id="header-8">Login code</h2>
<p>Users can access a portal without prior registration. They only need to enter an e-mail address or account name in the portal registration dialog. They will receive a login code by e-mail, which immediately forwards them to the corresponding portal. There they can vote for suggestions and edit action tickets. To do this, select<strong> Login Code</strong> as the authentication type on the <strong>Access permissions</strong> tab of the <strong>Settings</strong> sub-navigation before selecting a mail template that has to contain the new placeholder #portal_access_url#. The login code will remain valid for a certain period of time.</p>
<h2 id="header-9">Allowed Domains</h2>
<p>On the <strong>Access permissions</strong> tab of the <strong>Settings</strong> sub-navigation, you can define domains in advance to allow only the e-mail addresses for the invitation process of a guide that have the defined domains.</p>

<h2 id="header-10">Improvement: <em>Ideation</em> question type</h2>
<p>The<em> Ideation</em> matrix question type now has a checkable option to display other participants' suggestions that have already been made. In the free text field, you can enter a short description indicating that the suggestions have been received from other participants.</p>

<h2 id="header-11">Parallel access</h2>
<p>To prevent erroneous behavior when using email URL checkers, the option "Allow parallel access" is now activated by default. This will disable blocking of concurrent requests using the same invitation code. If you disable this option, the survey sessions started with the email invitation code may be deleted as soon as the URL scanners access them for verification.</p>
