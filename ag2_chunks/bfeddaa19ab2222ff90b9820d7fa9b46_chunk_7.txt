<h2 id="drafting-a-layout" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Drafting a Layout</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Usually, you will draft and realize your design for your panel or commission somebody to realize it. Of course, TIVIAN also offers custom designing of the external panel view. The following suggestions are aimed at helping you or your designer implement your layout.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>Which components will a page of your panel consist of?
<ul>
<li>Which page components do you require on all panel pages? The menu, for example, should be on all pages. All pages should also provide a section reserved for displaying error messages.</li>
<li>Which page components must be visible for logged-in and which for logged out panelists? The login form, for example, is usually displayed to all logged out panelists on all panel pages.</li>
<li>Are there any page components that are only to be inserted in a few selected pages? In the standard panel the quick poll, for example, is only displayed on the “Home” and “My Home” pages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are all required page components already available in the standard panel or do new templates need to be planned and created?</li>
<li>Should the public area and the internal panelist area have entirely different or slightly different layouts?</li>
<li>If you are setting up one website with several language versions or several websites, should the layout of the various websites and language versions differ?</li>
