<p>Your next step is to create a looped page, i.e. a page that will be displayed repeatedly, displaying one element of the loop list after the other. The procedure for this is similar to that for creating a filtered questionnaire page: In the row containing the loop page, click on the<strong> Create new page or filter</strong> icon, enter “Favorite programs” as the title, choose the “Standard” page type, and then click on <strong>Submit</strong> to save. The page will now be created as a looped page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create one or more questions on the page. Insert the question text, using the #TVchannel# wildcard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter any existing answer items as usual. (The example shown was simplified by choosing an open-ended question, for which this is not necessary.) Make any further required settings, and then click on <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">As usual, you can manually enter answer items for pages in a loop. However, it is also possible to access a dynamic or static list.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">For example, you can enter the answer items for the “Assessment by subject” page shown in the figure as with the standard procedure, but you can also retrieve the items from a list.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">To do so, please proceed as follows:</p>
<ol class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" start="1">
<li>
<p>Create the “Assessment by subject” page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On this page, create a question of the “Standard matrix 1” type (type 311).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the question text. In doing so, replace the name of the TV channel with the wildcard of the list that is associated with the loop, i.e., in this example, the #TVchannel# wildcard of the “TV channels” list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the “Scale” area and enter the scale for the matrix. Then, click on <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the “Dynamic answers” area and then click on the<strong> Select</strong> button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose the list you wish to use to determine the answer options, i.e., in this example, the “Subjects” list. Confirm by clicking on <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clicking on <strong>Back to the Editor</strong> will take you back to the question view. For the default answer options, tick the <strong>Delete</strong> checkbox.</p>

With interleaved loops or loops with many pass-throughs, this length can be exceeded. In projects with complex loops before survey commencement, you should therefore check whether the data can be exported subsequently by SPSS as desired.</p>
