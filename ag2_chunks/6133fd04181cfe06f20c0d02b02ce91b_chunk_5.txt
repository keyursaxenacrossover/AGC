<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-renderer-start-pos="10212">If both primary and secondary projects are personalized, then the secondary project requires authentication. For this, the participants’ authentication codes are used twice: The codes are generated in the secondary project and subsequently imported into a specially created participant variable of the primary project. When jumping from the primary to the secondary project, the codes are transferred as GET parameters to the variable “code”, and the authentication is performed automatically. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<ul class="ak-ul wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-indent-level="1">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="10734">Import the participants into the secondary project or create the accounts manually. The participants’ codes are usually generated by the system. (Alternatively, the codes can also be generated in Excel and imported along with the participants.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="10982">Next, the codes of the secondary project have to be extracted and imported into the primary project. Click on the <strong data-renderer-mark="true">Excel export</strong> or <strong data-renderer-mark="true">CSV export </strong>button to export the list of participants including the codes. The list of participants can be used as it is as an import file for the primary project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="11278">Proceed to import the participant data and codes into the primary project. From EFS 6.0, the codes can be imported directly: they are stored in the “code” database field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="11452">Assign the “code” column to the appropriate database field when importing into the primary project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="11555">The desired participant data including access code are now available in the primary project as well. Next, the jump page has to be configured so as to allow for automatic authentication by transfer of the code. Switch to the questionnaire of the primary project. Locate the jump page and, select the Edit page properties icon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="11889">Extend the URL so that the value of the variable #code# of the primary project is transferred to the “code” field of the secondary survey: http://www.efs-survey.de/xyz/?code=#code#</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="12073">Confirm by clicking on <strong data-renderer-mark="true">Save</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="12105">The return page in the secondary project is configured as usual.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-renderer-start-pos="12359">Since EFS 6.0, panel surveys can be used as target projects. I.e., you can route partici- pants from one panel survey to another, as long as both surveys are placed on the same installation. This option is used quite frequently, in particular in situations when the content of a survey has to be spread over several projects.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-renderer-start-pos="12686">There are two possible settings:</p>
