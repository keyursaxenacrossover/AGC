<h2 id="moving_items">Moving Items in the Questionnaire Editor</h2>
<p>To move items in the Questionnaire Editor, follow these steps:</p>
<h3 id="step1">Step 1</h3>
<p>Hover over the symbol with the 6 dots to the very left of the item you want to move. An arrow cross icon will be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="step2">Step 2</h3>
<p>Click on the symbol and drag the item to the desired place. You can move the item horizontally (e.g., several levels up or down) or vertically (e.g., under another item).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="important_note">Important Note on Moving Items</h2>
<p>While moving items, make sure that a black line is displayed. The line indicates the position to which you are moving an item. If the line is not displayed, the item won't be moved.</p>

<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863">FAQ</h1>
<h3 id="faq1">Can I move multiple items at once?</h3>
<p>The current guide does not specify if multiple items can be moved simultaneously. It's best to move items one at a time to ensure precise placement.</p>
<h3 id="faq2">Are there any restrictions on where I can move items?</h3>
<p>The guide doesn't mention specific restrictions. However, it's important to ensure that the black line is visible when moving items, as this indicates a valid placement position.</p>
