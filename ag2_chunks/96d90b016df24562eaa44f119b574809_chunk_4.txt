<br><strong>Copying actions</strong>
</h3>
<p>Thanks to the copy features of Action Planner, you can easily adapt existing actions for other parts of the structure. Two options are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>simply copying the selected action into a single target unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>multiple copying of the action into the units of a neighboring branch. It is up to you to decide from which “starting point” downwards the subunits of the branch should be filled with copies, and to which level depth. Up to three levels are possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All copying actions will be logged in detail in the copy log file of the source action. Proceed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Locate the action you want to copy and click on the <strong>Copy</strong> icon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define the target of the copying process:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Individual target unit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Target area</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next dialog, describe the target area more closely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have selected “Individual target unit”, all you need to do is select that target unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have selected “Target area”, define the starting point and the level depth for the copying process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirm by clicking on <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The action is copied. In the copying log, an entry will be made for every individual copy action.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01J3N2HWA9R2D0MNRR8C0E01ED"><strong>Moving actions</strong></h3>
<p>Now and then, it is necessary to change the unit of an action retroactively. Instead of deleting the action in the old unit and creating it anew in the next unit, you can simply move it. Proceed
