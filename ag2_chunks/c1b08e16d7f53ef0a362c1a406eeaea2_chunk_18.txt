<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If variable names are displayed within the <em>EFS Survey</em> the automatically preset, so-called internal variables are used. You can of course allocate alternative names which will be used on export instead of the internal names and then be available for external evaluation.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Internal variable names: These are the variable names that are automatically allocated by the system when creating a question and are used within EFS. These have the format v_000n and cannot be changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>External variable names: These names can be changed optionally by the user and are then used on export instead of the internal variable names.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>External variable names may have up to 64 characters.</p>

<li>
<p>The term “comment” should not be used as an external variable name (“comment” is a key term in PSPP, the program used for the SPSS export).</p>
