<p>If you have write rightss for “org_phase_admin”,, you can change the project phases directly via the Gantt chart.</p>

<p>To do so, click on the phase which you intend to activate. After a warning, its status will be changed to “active”, while the status of all previous phases is changed to “finished”.</p>

<li>
<p>Depending of the constellation, the status of the previous or following phase may change as well. If, for example, you change the status of the “Pretest” phase from “not yet started” to “active”, the status of the previously-activated “Setup” phase will be changed to “finished”.</p>

<h2 id="macros" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Macros</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Creating survey projects often involves performing identical steps: For example, with each new project the following must be repeated: importing the standard company layout, activating predefined survey messages, loading previously defined standard wildcards and creating participants. The actions required to end a project also repeat themselves: The project must be deactivated, result data exported and the codebook and online statistics saved as data for documentation purposes. The macro function permits automation of such steps: Specific actions can be preconfigured by the user and executed again at a later time at the push of a button. The macro function makes it possible not only to execute individual actions, but also to bundle several actions into a single macro. This does not only simplify working with <em>Survey</em>, but it also increases the uniformity of work processes.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">

<p>You create a macro both under the <strong>Project information</strong> menu item and under the <strong>Macros</strong> menu item in the <strong>Libraries</strong> menu. There you will find all macros available on the installation to which you have access, while the macros created under the <strong>Project information</strong> menu item are only available for the specific project.</p>
