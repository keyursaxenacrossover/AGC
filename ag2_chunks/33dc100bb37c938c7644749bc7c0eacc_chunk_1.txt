</ul>
</li>
<li>At the end of this activity, you are expected to have at least 2 surveys/projects created: at least an <strong>Anonymous</strong> one and a <strong>Personalized</strong> survey, where you have mixed the question types.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01J4NY1RXR2BNBX2BBP4YNNYQ0">Additional notes for the hands-on activity</h3>
<ul>
<li>You need to create your own folder, so when creating your folder, use this specific format: <strong>Central_training &lt;your_name&gt;</strong>
</li>
<li>Put folder below the <strong>Default </strong>folder</li>
<li>When creating projects/surveys:<br><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20635931444626" width="414" height="200"><br>
<ul>
<li>Any surveys that you create (as part of this tutorial/walkthrough/training) need to be <strong>placed in your own folder.</strong>
</li>
<li>It is best that you select <strong>English</strong> language</li>
<li>As <strong>Accounting Org</strong>, select <strong>Dummy Customer</strong>
</li>
<li>Make sure the project is shared with the <strong>System Administrator</strong> team</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note that the tutorials are based on the old UI of DXI/EFS, so don't panic! There has been a visual overhaul, but the functions should be organized in the same manner.</li>
<li>You will likely also see some special options missing, for example ones prepended with <strong>qb only</strong> tag; those functions are reserved for the <strong>root</strong> user only (which is a godlike admin), so you can ignore those for now.</li>
<li>Throughout the software, you can also hover over the <strong>i</strong> icon for information about each option.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01J4NY2EMF3BM22DDD9FJCF4KZ">Helper articles</h3>
<p>Doing side-by-side exploration as indicated above should provide enough to get you familiar with the end-to-end <strong>Projects</strong> experience. The below articles may also come in handy, but it would be recommended to refer to them only if you have something unclear from the tutorials, as they are pretty long-winded.</p>

<p>The below sub-topics are not covered in the video tutorials, and they represent other <strong>important</strong> core functionalities of the product, which you will most likely often encounter in your day-to-day DXI activities. </p>
<h4 id="h_01J4P4T90TNPC3WZTDNPCK19ER">GDPR</h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20229434833554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How-to: Privacy Assistant (GDPR)</a></strong></p>
<p>Given the nature of the software, privacy is an extremely important aspect, especially as a lot of our customers are from EU. The Privacy Assistant in Tivian's Enterprise Feedback Suite (EFS) is a feature designed to help users comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) when conducting surveys.</p>
<p>Remember, once you activate the Privacy Assistant and set your project to "Active," the status cannot be reversed.</p>
