<p>To link the orphaned projects to the dummy organisation we need to add the following statement to the first line of the <em>test.sql</em> file created in the previous step:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">UPDATE project_org
SET oid= DUMMY ORGANISATION ID
WHERE pid
IN ();</code></pre>
<p>The () of the statement needs to be filled in an SQL conform notation with the <em>pid</em>s from:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">SELECT pid FROM project WHERE pid IN (SELECT pid FROM project_org WHERE oid NOT IN (SELECT id FROM admin_contract_org));</code></pre>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff5630;">This statement will only work until this step. Make sure you have the project ids saved if you need them elsewhere!</span></strong></p>

<li>
<p>Source the file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">SOURCE test.sql;</code></pre>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now all the orphaned installations should be visible upon login as the dummy user. You can find the projects in the projects list and in the archive.</p>
