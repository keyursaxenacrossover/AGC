<h1 id="h_01J4KMQEY0F9NFDBA0Y6FG7KTK">Overview</h1>
<p>An important feature of EFS is to send emails. There are different features that send emails like survey participation, security emails etc.</p>
<p>On this page snailmail and jobmaker are part of the EFS software. This is not entirely true from a deployment perspective but good enough for this page.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>EFS software</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>creates email from templates and puts them in an email table</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>next to that an email procedure is created in another table - one procedure can have multiple emails</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the templates are filled when sending forwarding emails to the email server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there are two mechanism to actually send emails:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ad-hoc: An email is sent directly when sending is triggered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>snailmail: Emails are put in the email table and processed by a cron-job called snailmail that periodically loads un-sent emails and forwards them to the email server</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Email server - Postfix</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the postfix is used as a cache/queue for the Hurricane</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it simply forwads emails</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is done due to availability reasons with regards to the Hurricane and a VPN connection</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hurricane MTA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>this on premise solution is the actual email transfer server that sends the emails to the respective recipients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a callback is configured that is requested when the status of an email that should be sent changes</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tracking Service</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the tracking service is the recipient of the callback in Hurricane</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it pushed changes in the email status to a RabbitMQ</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tracking Queue</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Tracking Queue (RabbitMQ) serves as a publish/subscribe mechanism for notifications</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EFS software</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The cron-job Jobmaker of EFS has a task/job that periodically reads notifications from the Tracking Queue and adapts the email status accordingly</p>
