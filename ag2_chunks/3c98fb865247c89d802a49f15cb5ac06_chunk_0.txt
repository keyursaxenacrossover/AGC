<p>It's important to note that all date and time information in the EFS Admin area is converted to the corresponding local time. However, the <strong>default setting</strong> is UTC/GMT, so if not changed, it may appear that GMT is being used throughout the system.</p>
<h2 id="gmt_utc">GMT/UTC</h2>
<p>While UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is the more correct term, EFS uses GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) in its interface. For practical purposes in EFS, <strong>GMT and UTC can be considered equivalent.</strong></p>
<h3 id="job_list_export">Job List/Result Export</h3>
<p>In Exports, fields such as datetime, date_of_last_access, and date_of_first_mail are displayed in GMT/UTC.</p>

<h3 id="faq_default_time">What is the default time zone in EFS?</h3>
<p>The default time zone in EFS is UTC/GMT. If you haven't changed your personal settings, all times will appear in UTC/GMT.</p>

<h3 id="faq_utc_gmt">What's the difference between UTC and GMT in EFS?</h3>
<p>For practical purposes in EFS, there is no difference between UTC and GMT. Although UTC is the more technically correct term, EFS uses GMT in its interface.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J3Q7CXMWD20SMRB0W50PRJWM">If no time zone is stored for the recipient and the checkbox "Send from" uses the recipient's time zone" is not checked, what time timezone will be used?</h3>
<p>All participants are always assigned to a time zone. If nothing was defined during import, the time zone is Universal Time (UTC/GMT).</p>
<h3 id="h_01J3Q7EQQ9EV4M5S335NE0Z2CA">If I schedule an email for delivery, will it be sent according to UTC or my local time?</h3>
<p>All times within EFS are based on the time zone set by the admin user, unless GMT/UTC is explicitly specified mentioned. So, if you already have a timezone setup, it will be your local time.</p>
