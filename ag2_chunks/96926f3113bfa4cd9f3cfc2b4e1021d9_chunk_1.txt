<h2 id="ssl_customer">Customer-provided SSL certificates</h2>
<p>If a customer insists on using their own SSL certificate (<span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>not recommended</strong></span>), follow this workflow:</p>

<h3 id="csr_from_tivian">CSR from Tivian</h3>
<p>Request the following data from the customer for CSR (Certificate Signing Request):</p>
<pre><code>C=DE (Two Letter Country Code like US,DE,GB) 
ST=Hessen (Province/Country/State) 
L=Frankfurt am Main (City) 
O=Customer XYZ (Business Name) 
OU=IT (Department Name) 
CN= The fully qualified domain name of the domain, that shall be secured like www.3uu.de</code></pre>
<p>After the CSR is generated, it is supplied for the customer, who has to provide us with the SSL certificate, in the format found in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="no_csr_from_tivian">No CSR from Tivian</h3>
<p>If the customer generates the CSR, they can also generate the certificate by themselves. The customer must provide Tivian with the certificate in the following format:</p>
<ul>
<li>Format: ApacheModSSL</li>
<li>Files: CA + CRT (unencrypted)</li>
<li>Key (encrypted)</li>
<li>Type: x509 PEM</li>
</ul>

<p>Sales has to create an Opportunity in Salesforce. <br>Support needs a technical contact person from customer.</p>
