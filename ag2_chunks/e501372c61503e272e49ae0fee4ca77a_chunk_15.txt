<p>You can decide for yourself if the posts of the participants should be published immediately or only with the approval of a moderator. Available publishing modes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish immediately: All posts that are not blocked are displayed to all panelists.</li>
<li>Publish after approval: Initially, posts can only be seen by their respective author. Other panelists can only see the posts after a moderator has set their release status to “approved”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Optionally, you can allow panelists to upload files. If you check at least one file type as “permitted” and a maximum upload file size &gt; 0 is defined in the neighboring field, a file upload field will be displayed on the panel’s board page.</p>
<p>Please mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the file types named in the edit dialog are permitted.</li>
<li>For films in “flv” format, EFS provides a player, i.e. they are embedded properly into the post. The display of other video formats depends on the operating system, browser, and the plugins of the panelists.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a moderator, you can upload files into posts via the admin area, regardless of the settings made here.</p>

<p>If you enable file upload for panelists, you can specify the maximum file size in this field.</p>
<ul>
<li>The default value is 100 kb.</li>
<li>If you enter “0” or do not enter anything, the file upload function will be hidden.</li>
<li>The maximum technically possible value is installation- specifc; it is displayed in the dialog.</li>

<p>We recommend only permitting the upload of very small files, as all uploaded files must be stored and increase the size of the installation’s backup.</p>
<p>If you upload files as board administrator via the admin area, the settings made do not impose any restrictions on the size of files you upload. The maximum technically possible value for admins is installation-specifc; in case of doubt, please check with Support.</p>
