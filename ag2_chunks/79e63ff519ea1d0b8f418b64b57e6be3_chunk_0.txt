<h2 id="tivian_access_module">TIVIAN Access Module</h2>
<p>
  TIVIAN Access is an optional add-on module that can be integrated into our software package. Here's what you need to know:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>It's an optional feature that enhances our software capabilities.</li>
  <li>To order TIVIAN Access, visit: <a href="https://ww2.umfragecenter.de/uc/order_survey/">https://ww2.umfragecenter.de/uc/order_survey/</a>
</li>
  <li>Navigate to <code>modules &gt; TIVIAN SSO</code> to place your order.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="implementation_requirements">Implementation Requirements</h2>
<p>
  Before proceeding with the implementation of TIVIAN Access, there are two critical requirements that must be met:
</p>

<h3 id="test_user_agreement">1. Mandatory Test User Agreement</h3>
<p>
  It is absolutely essential to have a test user agreement in place before selling this module. Key points include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A mandatory test user must be provided (e.g., TivianSSO@customerdomain.com).</li>
  <li>This requirement is non-negotiable.</li>
  <li>Failure to provide a test user can result in service disruptions if changes need to be made and cannot be tested beforehand.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technical_contact">2. Qualified Technical Customer Contact</h3>
<p>
  A qualified technical contact from the customer's side is necessary. This person should:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be able to administer their Identity Provider (if there is an IdP).</li>
  <li>While this can be addressed during the implementation process, it remains an important requirement for smooth integration.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="important_considerations">Important Considerations</h2>
<p>
  It is crucial to adhere to the outlined requirements to ensure successful implementation and customer satisfaction. Failure to do so may result in:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Serious complications during the integration process.</li>
  <li>Customer dissatisfaction with the service.</li>
  <li>Potential disruptions in service functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  By following these guidelines, we maintain our commitment to quality and service excellence.
