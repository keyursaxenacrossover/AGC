<p>In the external view of your portal, the module will display all guides that have been started during the selected interval type, e.g. all guides started in one week. For each guide, a tile will be created that shows the guide title, the number of guides started per interval type, the trend, 4 team avatars and the total number of managers who started a guide. The data collection within the selected period will start by starting the module. For example, if you will start the module on Tuesdays and will have selected <em>weekly</em> as the interval type, all guides started since the last Tuesday will be displayed and compared with the 3 weeks before. The users of your portal can change the interval type selected in CMS area.</p>
<p>Activities are tracked as of the release update. As soon as the module is added, the data can be displayed in your portal.</p>

<em>Guides</em> Enhancements</h2>
<p>Many enhancements have been implemented to improve the usability of <em>Guides</em>. The guide status module called <em>Guide Waves</em> can be used within the workflow of the <em>ME-</em> and <em>US-Guides</em>. The preview of questions (Guide Setup) can be displayed in the language specified in the <strong>Project properties</strong>. <em>ME-</em> and <em>US-Guide</em> surveys can be offered via the <em>Cards</em> module.</p>
<h3 id="header-10">Suggested Group (Guide Setup)</h3>
<p>Initially, the group whose participant is the initiator of the guide is displayed. The prerequisite for this is that no company-administered group has been preselected.</p>
<h3 id="header-11">Additional Questions Remain Activated</h3>
<p>An <strong>Additional question</strong> that you had already activated for a previous guide wave remains even after it has ended. If you query the group again in the <strong>Guide Status</strong> menu, the <strong>Additional Questions</strong> set for the previous guide wave still exist.</p>
<h3 id="header-12">Additional Questions - Description of Context Variable</h3>
<p>To be able to create multilingual labels faster, it is now possible to enter a <strong>Description</strong> for the context variable in the <strong>Questionnaire</strong> configuration, which is then displayed as a title in the guide setup. Go to the <strong>Questionnaire</strong> menu of the desired guide and <strong>Show Additional Questions</strong>. The input field<strong> Description</strong> is now available in which you can enter a translation of the question. <strong>Save</strong> your entries. When you now start your guide setup, you will see the previously entered description as the title of the question.</p>

<p>In addition, you no longer have a character limit for <strong>Additional Questions</strong> and line breaks are automatically inserted when displayed in the guide.</p>
<h3 id="header-14">Extended Cards-Module (ME- and US-Guide)</h3>
<p>Guide surveys can now also be answered directly from the Cards module. For this, the invited user must be logged in and the survey must still be running. The background image of the card corresponds to the image of the associated guide. The remaining time for participation is displayed in the upper right corner.</p>
