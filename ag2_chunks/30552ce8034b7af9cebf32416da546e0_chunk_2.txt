<td style="width: 412.465px;">
<p>In the standard configuration, answer categories of the “answer option + text” type are only checked to verify whether the respondent has clicked on a radio button or a checkbox. However, you have the option of configuring the DAC in such a way that the respondent must select the answer option containing the text field and fill in the text field.</p>

If you send out e-mail invitations to a master data survey instead of simply<br>having the link displayed, you will also find all invited panelists in the “internal” sample and can keep track of who participates.</p>
<p>Apart from the automatically generated sample, you cannot set up any further samples for master data surveys.</p>

</td>
<td style="width: 412.465px;">
<p>You can set an upper limit of simultaneously active respondents. Participants with the disposition codes 20, 21, and 23 are active survey participants. Participants who have finished the survey (or have not been active for more than five minutes) are no longer active survey participants. Every 90 seconds, the software checks whether the upper limit has been exceeded. If this is the case, possible participants are rejected until the number of participants falls below the upper limit again, i.e. at least 90 seconds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The limit however can only undercut an eventual installation-wide setting for the maximum number of participants per project, it cannot bypass it.</p>
