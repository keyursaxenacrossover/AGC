ZV6GNHZR7">German Special Handling</h1>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
<p>Tivian DXi has a large German customer base, and part of this is that some contracts specify that some customers are supposed to receive support in German language <strong>ONLY</strong>. This means that <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>CS is required to send all responses to the below customers in German (both human and AI responses)</strong></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CitiBank</strong></li>
<li><strong>GlobalPark</strong></li>
<li><strong>Payback GmbH</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
Tickets handled by human agents will have a banner specifying this, and you need to pay attention to this sensitive detail moving forward and make sure you respond in German only to these tickets.</article>

<p><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21183018286866"></p>
<p>There are, however, some exceptions, as some users of these orgs do NOT speak German (example: <a href="https://central-supportdesk.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/4470201" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4470201</a>). There is a language override in place for these customers in ATLAS-chat, allowing them to select their language; <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>you will simply need to match their language</strong></span>. Further work will be done to clarify the process.</p>
<p>There are also 2 tags in each ticket that can be used as "reminders" for this German-language bind: <code>dxi_german_contract</code> and  <code>german_support</code>.</p>
<p>As for the AI side of things, Zendesk organizations will be configured in such a way that ATLAS-chat will respond in German to these customers, but it may happen that sometimes a customer account is not assigned to its rightful Zendesk organization, thus resulting in them not receiving German support.</p>
<p>If you ever come across this situation, please make sure that you assign the customer accounts to the rightful organizations in Zendesk.</p>
<h1 id="h_01J6A5QDGKX3ZFSZSHP5DQ1RPB">Temp escalation handling</h1>
<p>In the initial days of handling tickets, it is best that we keep track of the escalated tickets, so that they are reviewed by the legacy Tivian team.</p>
<p>Please use <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12F7JnqY0w-5eC28J-ACMLSNKNG7glnIOnZ8VYZsxPEo/edit?gid=1515788509#gid=1515788509">Tivian Escalated Tickets - Google Sheets</a></strong> in order to track all DXI escalations for further review, and the Tivian legacy team will review and assist with them.</p>
