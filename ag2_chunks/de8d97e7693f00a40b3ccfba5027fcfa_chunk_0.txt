<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The Report Manager in Reporting+ (TIVIAN's solution for EFS Survey and EFS Panel projects) now supports both individual and mass report generation (up to 40,000 reports). This new version emphasizes Employee use cases, allowing flexibility from single reports to bulk generation. To utilize it, use the Tagging Tool (a PowerPoint Add-In) to tag tables, charts, and text, then upload the tagged PPTX file to the template library for Report Definition. The core performance enables the Data Voyager Analyst to flexibly navigate data spaces. You can use the Data Space Query (DSQ) to relate units, depicting trends across different time waves. After publishing the Report Definition, choose from Ad Hoc, Standard, or Condition-based Reports, distribute them to EFS Employees, or download as PPTX/PDF files. A module in Portals also allows report provision. </p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Before every trip, taking precautions is essential. Similarly, exploring the data space requires preparation. The Report Manager necessitates preparatory actions to embark on your exploratory journey. Use the Tagging Tool to prepare PPTX shapes, enabling the filling of tables, diagrams, and text cells. Assign tags to each cell for future mapping in the Report Definition. In the following chapter, you will learn about the Tagging Tool, understand its user interface, and see its concrete application.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The <em>Tagging Tool</em> is a Power Point Add In and once installed, it can be found in the Power Point menu bar under <strong>Add Ins</strong>. Like any desktop software, it can be installed by double-clicking on the installation file.</p>

<h3 id="the-user-interface" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>The user interface</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You click on the tab <strong>DV Tagging Tool</strong> and you orientate yourself towards the control panel which is inserted from the right.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>There you will first discover the language selection symbolized by flags. You can choose between English and German.</li>
<li>Overhead you find a drop-down list with which you can move, resize and close the tool. You can close the tool with the adjacent <strong>X</strong> button, too.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">After clicking on the shape cell to be tagged, the <em>Tagging Tool</em> switches to the working view, which is divided into two visually separated areas: the information area and the tagging area.</p>
<h3 id="the-information-area" class="sc-erNlkL cxUUMl wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>The information area</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The upper area is the information area. The information area contains the shape name that you can change and the information about the shape type.</p>

<h3 id="the-tagging-area" class="sc-erNlkL cxUUMl wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>The tagging area</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The tagging area is preceded by two buttons: <strong>Add default tags </strong>and <strong>Add Tag</strong>. Next to the two buttons, there are two icons with which you can open or close all tags.</p>
