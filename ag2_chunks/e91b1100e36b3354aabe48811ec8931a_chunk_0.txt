<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Information</h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">With the community functions, the EFS Panel provides a solution to this challenge: Besides participating in surveys, participants are enabled to discuss directly with each other in forums and chats, as well as a blog, swap videos, or rate other community members. This will make the panel platform a vital source of information for decisions concerning marketing, market research, and product development. This combination of quantitative and qualitative feedback options will facilitate new forms of customer involvement. This guide covers the setup and configuration of panelist profiles, search functions, and various community features within the EFS Panel.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Among the most important characteristics of any online community are member profiles and search functions that allow for the targeted finding of other members.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><em>Profiles</em> give the members a face:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>They provide centralized access to all data on a member required for community life: ranging from a simple nickname and avatar in a largely anonymous community to personal details, self-characterizations, and the results of mutual ratings in the case of members of more complex communities.</li>
<li>For the most part, members use their profiles to introduce themselves beyond the basic data required by the community operator. They write short biographies or upload personal images, for example.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">A <em>search function</em> helps navigate the community:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>It allows you to find and contact members that you have met in a community forum, for example.</li>
<li>It allows you to search for members with similar interests.</li>
<li>Depending on how your search is configured, you may get an overview of the community’s makeup.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">EFS Panel provides tools and templates that allow you to set up and configure panelist profiles and search functions for your community panel based on your needs:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>You can decide for yourself which data are to be displayed in the profiles and returned by the search function.</li>
<li>Optionally, you can configure profiles, searches, and results lists in such a way that important personal data are used only with the express consent of the respective panelists. This is of particular importance for target groups with a strong interest in privacy and countries with strict privacy regulations.</li>
<li>Profiles, search forms, and results lists are created by combining a single form with a single-page module. At the same time, a variety of setting options provides flexibility: For example, you can display data in the profile that are used neither in the search nor in the results list.</li>
<li>You can set up profiles with different designs for the various language versions of your panel. Even within a single language version, you can use multiple sets of profiles. If your panelists include, for example, an expert group with its forum, you could use simple profiles with only a few personal data for the entire group while providing the experts in their “private” area with detailed profiles and search functions.</li>
</ul>
