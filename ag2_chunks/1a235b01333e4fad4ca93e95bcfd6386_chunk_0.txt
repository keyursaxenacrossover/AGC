<h3 id="h_01HGKSMPRT4ZKHRNRKXCXKQNKR">Step 2: Add Smiley Images to Answer Options</h3>
<p>Replace the text of each answer option with the HTML code for the corresponding smiley image. For example, instead of "very satisfied", use:</p>
<p><code>&lt;img src="images/griening.gif" width="32" height="32" border="0"&gt;</code></p>
<p>Replace "griening.gif" with the name of your uploaded smiley image file.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HGKSMPRT5ALKSNSKXDXLQNKR">Step 3: Copy File Path (Alternative Method)</h3>
<p>Alternatively, you can copy the file path directly from the media library.</p>
