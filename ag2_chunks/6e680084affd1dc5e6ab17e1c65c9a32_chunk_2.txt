<h2 id="header-15">Report Manager</h2>
<h3 id="header-17">Requirement profiles</h3>
<p>The <em>Report Manager </em>is the new product of the Employee portfolio. Rather unpretentious in the appearance, its advantages are on the side of the report generation, which can be carried out in a very large amount. But its qualities are not limited to such a scenario. </p>

<p>By the means of this new module, you evaluate the results of an employee survey that covers the many different departments of a company and you assemble those in reports instructively.</p>
<h3 id="header-18">The Report Definition</h3>
<p>The Report Definition that underlies each report of an order is the basis for the report generation. So you are working at a very abstract level. Finally, an order can contain thousands of reports and each of these reports is addressed to a different department. Nevertheless, you depict the individual shade of each department. To show how this works, you can emphasize two stations on the way to the completed reports: the mapping and the report order.</p>

<h3 id="header-19">The mapping</h3>
<p>The mapping is conducive to create a path for the data space query (DSQ). You define for which departments values are determined without first having to specify which departments are involved. The paradigmatic use case can serve as an illustration: If you want to generate reports for all departments that show the comparison of the regarding unit with the next higher one in relation to any value, it is sufficient to use the two units elements focus unit and level-up comparison unit and define the properties or result types that you want to query.</p>

<h3 id="header-20">The report order</h3>
<p>In the first step of the report order process, you determine the
