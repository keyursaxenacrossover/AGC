 <em>Report list</em> page module has been redesigned to improve usability and match the same design as other Portal modules, such as the <em>Portal invitation</em> module. It’s also been updated to provide a larger amount of generated reports for download. In the module setting, you can select which projects of the <em>Employee survey</em> type you want to offer for selection.</p>

<p>In the external view of the module, the released ES projects are then available to you in a drop-down list so that you can select them individually to download the reports available for each project. We’ve also greatly improved the filter options so it’s easier to find the right reports, quickly. In addition to the name or meta name of the units, you have two further filter functions by clicking on the filter icon: File type and language. If you do not select an ES project from the drop-down list, the project with the latest field phase end time is displayed first.</p>

<h3 id="header-11">Available master data in the user profile of <em>Portals</em>
</h3>
<p>It is really great to give Portal users contol over their own data, and we’ve been able to do that for a while in the Profile module. This gives them a place where they can change their name, email, address, etc. But it was always limited to text fields, which was frustrating some people.</p>

<p>So we’ve improved this by adding two new types of control: switches and lists. Switches will be diplayed for Master Data variables that are YES/No (boolean). A select box is displayed for integer variables that have response categories. A select box is also displayed for integer variables that do not have response categories. The default setting for all Master Data variables is a text box.</p>

<p><strong>New features for the </strong><em><strong>Action Board</strong></em></p>
<p>People love the Action Board! But they’ve also got a lot of great ideas of how it can be even better. So we’ve added some important new features in this release. You can now assign a due date to an action, easily share files, and we’ve added more notification settings to make sure people don’t miss a single thing!</p>
<p><u>Due date</u></p>
<p>In the detail view of the action ticket, you specify a due date to ensure that the action will have been executed by a certain date (of course, you can’t add a due date to items that have already been archived or completed). In the<br><em>Action Board</em> module configuration, you can configure email notifications regarding the due date and a due date reminder. You also specify how many days before the due date a reminder email is to be sent.</p>

<p><u>Adding files</u></p>
<p>You can now add files to the details view of your action, making it even easier to collaborate with your team. You can even Drag &amp; Drop from your desktop right into the action. Files can be uploaded by anyone the action has been shared with, and all viewers can click on the file to download. If an action is deleted, all uploaded files are immediately removed; however, if an action is archived all files are retained. A maximum of 5 files with a maximum individual file size of 8MB can be added to each action in the board.</p>
<p><u>Do not send e-mails</u></p>
<p>Email notification are fine, but some users asked for more control. So from now on you can also use the option “no emails” in the module configuration of the<em> Action Board</em> module to send no e-mail notifications for that particular trigger. Note that if you select this option, then neither e-mails nor push messages are sent, even if those notification options have been activated in the user profile.</p>

<h3 id="header-12">Module modifications</h3>
<p><u>Task List</u></p>
<p>The Task List module connects directly to the Action Planner in EFS, and is very useful for complex workflows like Closed Loop Feedbacks. So we’ve added support for the file upload/download to this, too.</p>
<p>After upload, files are displayed in the tasks, but only for those who have access to this task. You also have a new sort order that allows you to sort the tasks in ascending or descending order by title, end date, status, or creation. A maximum of 5 files, with a maximum file size of 8MB can
