They federate with our Identity Provider and Coca Cola Employees can sign into EFS using their corporate credentials. If they change their password it has to be only done once on Coca Cola side. They also use these credentials for their intranet/tools, so they will not forget their credentials.</p><p><br></p><ac:image ac:align="center" ac:layout="center" ac:src="https://qbdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/996507859/Glossary%20-%20Part%201%20-%20Federation.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1568279026409&amp;cacheVersion=1&amp;api=v2&amp;width=531&amp;height=400"><ri:url ri:value="https://qbdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/996507859/Glossary%20-%20Part%201%20-%20Federation.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1568279026409&amp;cacheVersion=1&amp;api=v2&amp;width=531&amp;height=400"></ri:url></ac:image> the user is send to another Identity Provider for the authentication process.</p><p>Benefits of this are that the credentials of the user are managed and known in only one place (the federated external Identity Provider).</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>A client (e.g: Coca Cola) has its own Identity Provider in place.
