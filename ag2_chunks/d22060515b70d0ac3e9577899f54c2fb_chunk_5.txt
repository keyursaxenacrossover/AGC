wyg-text-align-justify">The conscientiousness with which survey participants fill in questionnaires is critical for the quality of the results of online surveys. The results from survey participants that merely click very quickly through the questionnaire, for example, to get a quick overview of the survey theme or on completion to participate in a prize draw, are of little value for further analysis in the end. The quality correction program helps you to recognize participants who simply “clicked through” by their answer behavior, to mark these data records, and if desired to delete them.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Response times as quality criterion</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The response times of a user are the key criteria needed for indexing the quality of survey participants. The time taken by each participant to complete a particular page of a survey can be calculated. First of all an index is formed for each participant that gives information on his mean processing time for a questionnaire page. Please note here: The time required by a participant to complete an entire survey is not a factor in the calculation. Depending on the direction of the questionnaire the number of pages that the participant sees can also vary tremendously.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Subsequently, a separate calculation for each page is made, which shows where the survey participant is about the processing time of the media. The median survey time of 100 participants corresponds to the average survey duration of the 50th and the 51st survey participants when these have been sorted by survey time.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Determining the quality index for individual users</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">To determine the “quality” of a participant in a survey, his processing time is set in relation to the average processing time of the entire sample. The relationship can be expressed as a number that is stored in the variable “quality”. The value of 0,5 stands for the results of a survey of high quality. A higher value represents a higher quality of the results of the survey. A value below 0.5 stands for lower quality.</p>
<h3 id="triggering-quality-correction" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Triggering quality correction</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can start the program that calculates the quality index under<strong> Projects</strong> → {Selected project} → <strong>Statistics → Quality correction</strong> by clicking on the button <strong>Save</strong>. It does not make any changes to the actual survey data, rather it expands the data record to include the variable “quality”.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Quality correction should not be triggered when large surveys are being conducted simultaneously in the installation. Only a few hundred participants have no impact on the quality correction conducted at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="viewing-the-quality-index-in-the-export-data-record" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Viewing the quality Index in the export data record</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The quality index of a participant will be stored in the variable “quality”. This is contained within the export data record, and therefore you can identify the data records of participants with critical values and where necessary delete them before making an evaluation.</p>
<h2 id="data-cleaning" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Data cleaning</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If a respondent uses the “Back” button in the questionnaire or that of the browser while completing a questionnaire, they may pass the same filter question more than once, giving different answers and then being routed into another filter branch, where they will answer different questions.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Example: Somebody answers the question of whether they drive a car with “Yes” and is subsequently asked all car-related questions. Then, they go back to the questionnaire and state they do not drive a car. A filter lets them skip all car-related questions now. When the respondent completes the survey, they will have stated they do not drive a car. Nonetheless, all car-related variables will contain values.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In the past, such irrelevant data had to be manually cleaned from the result data. With the “Data cleaning” function, this cleaning process has been automated.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Please note</strong>:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">

<p>Data cleaning only takes completed interviews into consideration, i.e. records with status 31 or 32.</p>
