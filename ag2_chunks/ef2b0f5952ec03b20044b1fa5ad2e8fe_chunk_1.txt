<h2 id="header-10"><strong>New features for More Effective Dashboard Creation</strong></h2>
<p>Our goal at Tivian is always to improve the functionality and user experience of our products. In order to be able to set up projects even more efficiently and provide you with dashboards even faster, we have successfully completed two other internal undertakings – the development of Tivian Analytics and the migration of MySight to AWS Hosting.</p>
<h3 id="header-12"><strong>Tivian Analytics</strong></h3>
<p>Tivian Analytics is an important internal release that allows us to create guide-based dashboards for you even faster and more efficiently. It has been specifically designed for multi-rater feedback, such as Leadership 360° and Pulse surveys, and its simple configuration options ensure that you can start your projects even faster.</p>

<h3 id="header-13"><strong>MySight</strong></h3>
<p>We have switched to high-performance AWS hosting for MySight so that you can now benefit from optimum speed when using the software. In addition, a number of new Tableau-based features for analytics and dashboards are now available, providing an even better web-authoring experience and making it even easier to create and edit visualizations directly from the web browser. These features include, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved accessibility</strong>: A more consistent tab order makes it easier to navigate the dashboard using the keyboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explain Data</strong>: This feature provides an explanation of the data displayed and identifies interesting data points such as extreme values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set Control</strong>: Set controls allow users to dynamically change the elements of a set without having to change the underlying data source.</p>
</li>
