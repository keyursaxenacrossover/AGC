<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>

<p>You want to reuse parts of the organizational structure elsewhere in the same project.

<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Locate the desired unit in the organizational structure. Click on the <strong>Actions</strong> icon to open the selection layer and then click on the link <strong>Export to Excel</strong>.</p>

<li>
<p>Specify the extent of the export data record. The following options are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Standard export</p>

<li>
<p>Standard export and user-defined variables: If you have created additional structure variables (see Chapter 4.4, p. 56), this option may be useful.</p>

<p>The second row, directly under the column labels, contains the reference unit, i.e., the unit under which the new structure is to be imported.</p>

<li>
<p>If you duplicate an already existing substructure in the same project, e.g. in another department or in another structure view, you have to change the meta names. If you do not want to change each meta name by hand, you can use the option “Automatically generate meta name prefixes” when reimporting.</p>
