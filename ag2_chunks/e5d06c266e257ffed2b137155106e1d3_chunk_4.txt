 The disposition code 42 is assigned to the participants who do not give their consent.</p>
<h3 id="header-33">Libraries: Create consent form templates</h3>
<p>You do not have to configure the privacy consent form for each project anew. Instead, you create templates in the Libraries, which you use as required when creating a privacy consent form. Pre-filled forms including the most common applications can also be found there, so that you have GDPR-compliant consent forms by means of minor but indispensable adjustments to your project conditions. The configuration is the same as in the questionnaire editor. When you create the consent page in the questionnaire editor you select the language first, so that the selection of the consent form is automatically limited to those with the matching language. Then you assign a name. In the text field, you enter the purpose for which the data is processed. By means of the following fields you inform the participant about the privacy information.</p>
<h3 id="header-34">The flagging of questions and variables as personal data</h3>
<p>The creation of questions and participant variables has also been modified by giving you the<br>option for each question or variable you create: “Flag question as personal data” respectively “Flag as personal data”. In addition to the option of marking questions independently as personal data, question types 141 to 144, i.e. those that have a free text field, are marked as personal data by default. This setting can be deactivated. With the new icon, padlock, you can see which questions of the questionnaire have been marked as personal data or deselect them again. The selections cannot be removed for the following variables that have already been marked as personal data in the default settings: u_account, u_email, u_firstname, u_name, u_street, u_zip, u_city, u_address (all), u_phone, u_mobile, u_mobile2, u_www, u_gender, and panel_contact. The following participant data are unchangeably marked as personal data: u_email, u_firstname, u_name, u_mobile, u_gender, remote_addr, participant_latitude, participant_longitude, and remote_host. For the variables of the system users these are: u_account, u_firstname, u_name, u_email, u_mobile, u_gender, u_street, u_zip, u_city, u_country, u_phone, u_mobile2, and u_www. For the Org user these are: u_firstname, u_name, u_email, and u_gender.</p>
<h3 id="header-35">The privacy consent form preceding the survey</h3>
<p>The privacy consent form precedes the survey and is structured as follows for the potential survey participants: After the welcome message, they read the text informing about the purpose of the data processing. The contact data of the controller follows. By means of a link they can then call up further privacy information and agree on the basis of the given information. The survey is started by clicking the corresponding button. The link “I don’t want to participate” gives those who do not wish to give their consent the opportunity to do so. However, before the participants finally leave the privacy consent form, they must confirm their rejection. The privacy consent form has the language switch, so that the survey language can be changed on this page.</p>
<h3 id="header-36">The portability of personal data</h3>
<p>If a data subject requests you as a data controller to view the personal data collected about him or her, please contact Tivian. You provide the code and/or e-mail address of this subject and Quesback will provide you with an overview of the personal data concerning this subject in a common and readable format.</p>
<h3 id="header-37">The deletion of personal data</h3>
<p>In principle, personal data will be deleted at the end of the retention period specified for a project. It is also possible for the data subject to contact the data controller with the request for data deletion. You pass on the e-mail address and/or code of the participant who wishes to be deleted to Tivian. In this way, the participant can be identified and deleted from the system. One way of independently deleting personal data of all participants in a project can be found in the survey menu under "Text and Validation", where you can click on the "Delete personal data" button via the "Reset survey" item. The personal data of all participants who have a disposition code higher than 12 within the scope of the project will be deleted. The deleted data no longer appear in MySight after automatic synchronization. These are removed from the existing dashboards. The deleted personal data can no longer be found in the detailed view of a project, but also not in the corresponding participant lists.</p>
