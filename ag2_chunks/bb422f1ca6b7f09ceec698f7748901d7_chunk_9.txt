<p data-renderer-start-pos="11423">Open the export file. The <em data-renderer-mark="true">quality</em> column provides information about the quality of a survey participation. The value for the quality variable is calculated by relating the individual processing time of a participant to the mean processing time of the entire sample and lies between 0 and 1. A value of 0.5, which is exactly on average, indicates a high quality of participation. Participants, who spent more time on the survey, are above this value. Participants, who are significantly below a value of 0.5, should be viewed critically and their survey responses might not be relevant for the further evaluation of the survey. In the example below, you can see that the participant in the 5th row has a value of 0,23 in the <em data-renderer-mark="true">quality</em> column. This would therefore be a participant, whose data records you could delete for quality purposes.<img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21013850212114"></p>
