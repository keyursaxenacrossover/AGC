<h2 id="accessible_surveys">Accessible Surveys</h2>
<p>The Responsive Layout 3 standard layout includes major improvements in accessibility for surveys. The Information section informs users whether the survey and its questions are accessible with screen readers.</p>
<p><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21015358997010"></p>
<p>All standard question types are created barrier-free, meaning that each page can be captured, structured, and read by screen reader software and be completely controlled by keyboard (via tab and arrow keys).</p>

<p>The green symbol in the info column indicates whether the question type is barrier-free. Color-coded (green) question types are accessible. Complex question types (Hotspot, Images) may not be barrier-free, as they rely on further descriptions of visible images by the survey creator.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility_portals">Accessibility of Portals</h2>
<p>Portals (exterior view) now feature an accessible navigation system. Improvements have been made to various components:</p>
<h3 id="modal_dialog">Modal and confirmation dialog</h3>
<p>Modals, confirmation, and delete dialogs in Guides (setup), Groups, and Task list have received a tab index or tab order corresponding to the visible order within the modal or dialog. This prevents jumping to the page behind the opened dialog or modal when using the tab key. Screen readers can detect the current position in the guide wizard and display the corresponding information.</p>
<h3 id="text_box">Text box</h3>
<p>When a text box is opened, it immediately receives focus.</p>
<h3 id="search">Search for persons and groups</h3>
<p>Person and group search results are presented by the screen reader and can be accessed via keyboard. The search field is recognized as a combo box, and list values can be selected with arrow keys and presented by the screen reader. This function is available in the Guides (Setup) module and the Groups module.</p>
<h3 id="menus">Menus</h3>
<p>All menus (Burger Menu, User Menu, Three-Point Menu, Notification Menu, and Sidebar) can be opened using the keyboard, with menu entries presented by the screen reader.</p>
<h3 id="slide_switch">Slide switch</h3>
<p>Slide switches in the user menu, notification menu of the user profile, and guide setup can be operated using the keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="popups_dialogs">Pop-ups and Dialogs</h3>
<p>Further features have been implemented to improve the accessibility of Portals. After opening, pop-ups and dialogs will be focused directly. If the dialog does not contain input fields but buttons, the confirmation button will be focused. If the dialog contains an input field, the first available input field will be focused. If the dialogs have no interactive elements, the main content area will be focused. Dialogs can be closed by pressing the Esc key.</p>
<h3 id="header">Header</h3>
<p>In the guide setup, a header is displayed so that participants and groups can be read out by the screen reader. Pressing the Return key directly applies the result of the participant and group search.</p>
<h3 id="detail_view">Detail View</h3>
<p>In the Action Ticket detail view, the Tab key moves focus from left to right and top to bottom. The first element to focus is the Close button.</p>
<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863">FAQ</h1>
<h3 id="faq_1">What improvements have been made to surveys for accessibility?</h3>

<h3 id="faq_2">How have Portals been improved for accessibility?</h3>
<p>Portals now have an accessible navigation system, with improvements to modals, dialogs, text fields, search functions, menus, and slide switches. These enhancements make it easier for users with screen readers to navigate and interact with the Portal interface.</p>

<p>While all standard question types are accessible, complex question types like Hotspot and Images may not be fully barrier-free, as they often require additional descriptions of visible elements by the survey creator.</p>
