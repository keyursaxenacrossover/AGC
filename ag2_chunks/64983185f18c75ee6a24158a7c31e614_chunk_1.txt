<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863">FAQ</h1>
<h3 id="h_01HGKSMPRSQNKXBXQXD4QXBG9S">What is lfdn?</h3>
<p>lfdn stands for "laufende Feldnummer" in German, which translates to "consecutive field number" in English. Every participant has a unique lfdn, which is essentially a participant's consecutive number. By using this number with the Modulo function, you can create a random trigger with a uniform distribution.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HGKSMPRSQNKXBXQXD4QXBG9T">Why is this method better than using a Random-Trigger with infinite participants?</h3>
<p>This method using Modulo and Recoding-Trigger is more efficient because it avoids the complexity of running through all participants, which can cause slow installation, participant rejection, and long loading times for the trigger. It provides a simpler and faster way to achieve a uniform distribution for random triggering.</p>
