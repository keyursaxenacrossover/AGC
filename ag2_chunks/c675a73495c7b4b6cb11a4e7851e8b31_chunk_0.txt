<h3 id="h_01J3QCGXRBJGT8T8RDYWPTBJ9K" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>The standard character set for EFS Survey: UTF-8</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The EFS Survey admin area is coded in UTF-8. Similarly, for newly created projects the<br>UTF-8 character set is set as default, if you have not made any different presettings for your<br>account.<br>UTF-8 is a character set defined by the Unicode Consortium.<br>Using UTF-8 will significantly facilitate implementation of foreign language and multilingual projects, in particular:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>UTF-8 encompasses all characters that there are, thus all literary languages can be<br>reproduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can enter characters from any given language directly in the admin area using<br>the keyboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of the entered data and settings will be saved internally and uniformly in UTF8 – questionnaire texts, participant data, and internal EFS Survey data, such as to-do notes or user accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The answers of participants to open questions are coded uniformly in UTF-8, thus<br>all open entries in multilingual surveys can be exported and viewed in one single<br>record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Survey and panel passwords can contain characters from all possible languages</p>
</li>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can set the character set of your projects yourself. Tivian recommends the use<br>of the UTF-8 in general, this is true in particular with surveys that otherwise would<br>require several character sets.<br>The following table contains a complete selection of all available character sets.</p>
