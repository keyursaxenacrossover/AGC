<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In the past, such irrelevant data had to be manually cleaned from the result data. With the “Data cleaning” function, this cleaning process has been automated.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Please note</strong>:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Data cleaning only takes completed interviews into consideration, i.e. records with status 31 or 32.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following routing types are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Filter” and “Random rotation” branches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trigger types that affect routing via changes in the survey results. The function should, however, not be used in projects involving page triggers: In this case, the routing that the respondent took erroneously or for test purposes cannot be unambiguously identified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Action pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depot questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EFS-side <strong>Back</strong> buttons. Please note: browser-side <strong>Back</strong> buttons are not fully supported. If a respondent skips back several pages using the browser <strong>Back </strong>button first and then skips forward several pages using the browser <strong>Forward</strong> button ignoring the system warning, these steps cannot be tracked and stored correctly. I.e. pages might be missing in page history, though valid data from these pages exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Random rotation” branches and loops are not supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data cleaning should not be applied to surveys that are prefilled with values. I.e. it should not be combined with the options “Transfer master data values to survey variables” → “Always prefill”, “Allow multiple participations, prefill with values of last participation” (Chapter 3.7.10, p. 92), and import of specific answers from other projects.</p>
