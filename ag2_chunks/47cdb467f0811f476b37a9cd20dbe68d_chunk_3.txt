<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-renderer-start-pos="3545">Now you know, how to deliver your anonymous survey to your participants. But how can you determine, whether participants can only take the survey once or several times? In EFS, you can set this by activating or deactivating cookies for your survey.</p>

If they click on the survey link again, after they have already fully answered all questions, the following message will be displayed: “Sorry, but you have already completed this survey. Thank you for participating”. However, by using cookies and saving session data through it, you can enable participants to suspend the survey and resume it on the same page afterward.</p>

Session data is not stored, so each click on the survey link creates a new session or data set. Because of that, participants cannot suspend the survey and resume it at a later point, as they are not recognized by the system due to the messing session data.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-renderer-start-pos="5290">When you create a <em data-renderer-mark="true">personalized survey</em>, you know your survey participants in advance. Usually, the link to your survey is sent to participants via email. But before you can send email invites to your survey, you first have to add participants in the participant administration. The sum of all survey participants represents the so-called sample. During the field phase of your survey – i.e. the time, in which you carry out your survey – you can add additional participants to your sample at any given time.</p>
