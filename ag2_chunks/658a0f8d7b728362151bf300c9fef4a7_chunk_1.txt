 the purpose of exposing the AD to the public and supporting protocols like SAML or OpenID Connect. Expose AD with Okta AgentBlue</p>

<p> </p>
<h1 id="header-1">Pros of the Okta Agent</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More clients could be supported for the SSO module in EFS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offers more features than “a normal ADFS” e.g: synchronizing profiles from AD to Okta</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-3">Cons of the Okta Agent</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Costs more money (starting at 21k / year, we also paid more for the other add-ons than advertised)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same thing (solving that ADs can be used for the scoped use cases) can be achieved with other tools (see ADFS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have not tested this yet and this will definitely <strong>increase the scope</strong> till December (at least from a testing perspective, since it will be hard to setup such a setting)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional features will be hard to support since this is not a common feature for Identity Providers speaking SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect</p>
