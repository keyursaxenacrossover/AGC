<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The downloaded data is not a backup copy of the entire project, and cannot be viewed outside of EFS or recreated using an import function.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Pay careful attention that you upload the correct file, otherwise reactivation of the project will not be possible. Should you upload the wrong zip file, delete it first by clicking on the <strong>Delete</strong> button, and then upload the correct file.</p>
<h3 id="reactivating-archived-projects" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Reactivating archived projects</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">When you click on the Reactivate icon you are given two options:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>reactivate with result data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reactivate without result data</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If the zip file with result data has been deleted, the only option available is “Reactivate without result data”.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The following applies to reactivation processes as well as to the archiving of projects: Firstly the process can take a very long time. Secondly, some of the database tables are blocked during the reactivation process, so it is not possible during reactivation to participate in a survey. Therefore it is also recommended that reactivating is done during phases of low traffic, i.e. at night.</p>
