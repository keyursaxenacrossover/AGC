<h2 id="dmarc">DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance)</h2>
<p>DMARC is a specification developed to reduce email abuse. It builds upon SPF and DKIM.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J3QC5JPBK0PQYZ4B7D409V4Z">How to check DMARC</h3>
<ol>
<li>Visit <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/DMARC.aspx">MX Toolbox DMARC Lookup</a>
</li>
<li>Enter your domain in the search field</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> DMARC is only effective when SPF and DKIM are already set up.</em></p>
<h2 id="whitelisting">Whitelisting</h2>
<p>Whitelists are positive lists that certify a listed sender with a special reputation and ensure preferential treatment of their emails by email providers.</p>
<h2 id="blacklisting">Blacklisting</h2>
<p>Blacklisting involves blocking IP addresses of email addresses that have been classified as spammers due to suspicious behavior. These IP addresses are placed on a blacklist and emails from them are not delivered.</p>
<h2 id="external-mailserver">External Mailserver</h2>
<p>Customers can use their own mail server or mailing infrastructure for sending emails. If customers use their own mail server, you can verify this by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finding the following in Globis under 'Modules': use_hurricane_mta hurricane_snailmail_port</li>
<li>On the installation: <strong>Options &gt; Mail-Admin &gt; Mail-Report</strong> , if the columns <strong>Rejected</strong>, <strong>Not delivered</strong>, <strong>Not reachable</strong> are missing here, then this is also an indication that an external mail server is being used.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h_01J3QC5JPBH139TA96KRMD6ZTN">How to set up an external mailserver</h3>
<p>To set up an external mailserver, the customer needs to provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Server/Host</li>
<li>Port</li>
<li>Account/User</li>
<li>Password</li>
</ul>
<p>In some instances, the customer mailserver would require some whitelisting of IP's to allow relaying. In this case, you can refer to <a href="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20384907492370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outgoing NAT IP addresses productive environments</a></p>
<h2 id="mail-reputation">Mail Reputation</h2>
<p>You can test the reputation of your emails using tools like <a href="https://www.mail-tester.com">Mail Tester</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>First call up the mail template on the installation: <strong>Preview button (top left) &gt; Send test mail</strong> and enter the mail address specified by the Mail Tester tool here</li>
<li>Then check the result in the Mail Tester. (The result sometimes takes a while)</li>
