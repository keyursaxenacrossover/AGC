<h2 id="reasons">Reasons for Access Code Requests</h2>
<p>There are two main reasons why survey participants might be asked for an access code:</p>
<ol>
<li>The session duration has expired, often due to the participant pausing the survey for an extended period.</li>
<li>The distribution link is incomplete, possibly due to errors in copying and pasting the link.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="solutions">Solutions to Access Issues</h2>
<h3 id="h_01J3A2QE962SFGW5JYBSQ6A0YV">For Expired Sessions</h3>
<p>If the session has expired, the participant simply needs to click on the invitation link again to regain access to the survey.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J3A2QE9684069FEWYKKE5BCS">For Incomplete Distribution Links</h3>
<p>The participant should check if the survey link they received is complete. Incomplete links may result from improper copying and pasting of the URL.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="prevention">Preventing Access Code Issues</h2>
<p>To prevent access code issues, especially those related to email URL scanners (such as those used in Office 365), follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Survey Settings</li>
<li>Navigate to Login Options</li>
<li>Activate the checkbox for "Allow parallel access"</li>
</ol>
<p>This setting helps mitigate problems caused by email security features that may interfere with survey links.</p>
