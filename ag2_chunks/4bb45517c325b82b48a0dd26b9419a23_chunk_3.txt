<p>If a survey’s master data allocation fails (e.g., <code>md_us_ca_corn</code> is not updated), this indicates that the transfer of data from the survey to the master data section encountered an issue. All the above steps apply, in addition to the below.</p>
<h4 id="h_01JAMY3QTZ26R87DTYX4GG3F4C">
<strong>Steps</strong>:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Master Data Allocation Setup</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify that the master data allocation rules in the survey setup were correct. This can be checked in the survey configuration under <strong>Survey menu &gt;&gt; Master Data Allocation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Check the step which should transfer the master data, and when should the transfer EXECUTE</strong>
<ul>
<li>For instance, check this example survey where the participant had been set to dispostione code/status 31 respectively 32 and we know that this is happening on the final page.
<p><span style="opacity: 1;"><img id="image_39a7b195-25a6-4b5e-b470-34545b99be52" class="image_resized" style="width: 788px;" src="https://central-supportdesk.zendesk.com/attachments/token/EtF7IJ2IZ02qPycuv2oLEedAU/?name=inlineImage.png"></span></p>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Important: </strong>Check when is the <strong>transfer of the master data allocation</strong> processed. <br>For example, in the below it is configured when completing the survey (in other words when reaching the final page).</p>
<p><span style="opacity: 1;"><img id="image_4778ccd0-520c-409d-91b8-f969bcc11825" class="image_resized" style="width: 870px;" src="https://central-supportdesk.zendesk.com/attachments/token/ckOFRFnKqSzq0diEZIhMPLUMS/?name=inlineImage.png"></span></p>
<p>Therefore we know "when" this should happen, which is at around the same time the participant was set to "<em>status</em> = 31" which is the "<em>date_of_last_access</em>". Both are meta data of the survey and could be found in the `sample_data` table</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check Transfer in Logs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use AWS logs to trace when the system attempted to update the master data. Cross-check these logs with the timestamps for the survey completion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Investigate Missing Updates</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the logs indicate that the transfer did not happen, check if the participant’s connection was abandoned or if a specific variable (e.g., <code>md_us_ca_corn</code>) had a trigger issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>DB Updates</strong> additional note:
<ul>
<li>
<p>Please also note. If you looking for anything survey related you always will have updates of the <strong>sample_data</strong> and the <strong>survey</strong> table each time a participant sends a survey page (hits the Next/Continue button in a survey)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can always limit this (in CW logs) by the unique values for a participant (i.e. uid, lfdn, session_id).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You also can look at the page if there are further things which could affect other tables (i.e. triggers on a page which are executed when sending the page or triggers on the follow up page which are executed "directly", which is more or less at the same time...)</p>
<p> </p>

<p>To effectively troubleshoot survey reply issues and master data updates, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Step1: </strong>Use GUI or MariaDB to detect the exact timings of requests when a Specific User Filled a specific Survey</li>
<li>
<strong>Step 2</strong> Use MariaDB to trace survey replies via tables like <code>sample_data</code> and <code>survey_{{PID}}</code>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Step 3</strong>: Review AWS logs to track incomplete or failed connections that might have prevented survey data from being transferred.</li>
<li>
<strong>Step 4</strong>: Check Grafana PHP logs to identify errors during survey submission on PHP level.</li>
<li>
<strong>Step 5</strong>: Ensure that master data allocations are set up correctly and transferred properly by analyzing logs and database entries.</li>
</ul>
