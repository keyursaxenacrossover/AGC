</table><p></p><h2 id="header-3">Redirecting after e-mail action:</h2><p>Some e-mails lead to an action a user has to fulfill on Okta side (activation, reset password). In that cases Okta does not know the context - especially the app - in which the user action happens. Therefore the redirect after the action will lead to a default page.</p><p>This can be changes using a “fromURI” field for the respective link in the e-mail as query parameter. It will have the value of the URL to the page that the user should be redirected after the action is done.</p><p><u>Example:</u></p><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;a href="{activationLink}?
