<h2 id="h_01HGKSMPRT0YJQCJ8XDQX3NZMS">Data Protection and Combined Export</h2>
<p>For data protection reasons, combining personal and survey data is not possible by default. Test users or respondents must be informed in advance if their personal data will be linked to their survey responses.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="h_01HGKSMPRT8KXBP0QXDQGHX8QT">Obtaining Export Rights</h2>
<p>To enable the combined export of personal and survey data, an extra right is required. This right is not activated by default and must be specifically requested.</p>
