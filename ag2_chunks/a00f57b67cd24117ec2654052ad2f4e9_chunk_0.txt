<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK">Information</h1>
<p>Version 23.1 introduces a new feature that allows for the optional expiration of inactive admin accounts. This feature is controlled by a new configuration variable and only affects users not assigned to "internal" organizations.</p>
<p>The new feature is controlled by the configuration variable <code>admin_login_expire_on_inactivity</code>. Here are the key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The value is stored in days</li>
<li>By default, the value is set to "0" (inactive)</li>
<li>This feature only affects users not assigned to "internal" organizations</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementation of this feature involves a daily running job, so the effect is not immediate upon activation of the feature.</p>
<h3 id="implementation_example">Example Scenario</h3>
<p>For instance, on installation A:</p>
<ul>
<li>The job runs daily at 11:30 a.m.</li>
<li>If the feature is activated at 12:00 a.m.</li>
<li>It would not affect the corresponding accounts until the next day, after the job has run at 11:30 a.m.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="h_01J3YSEFDHKA8A7FPYM485G01Y">Agent steps</h1>
<p>To activate the feature, you need to access the account using the 'root' user, then go to <em>Option &gt; Platform Cockpit</em> and enable the option.</p>
