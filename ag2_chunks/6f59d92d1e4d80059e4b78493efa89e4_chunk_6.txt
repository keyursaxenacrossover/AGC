It is up to your creativity to define challenging tasks for your panelists. E.g. you can send your panelists to any panel page or external website, you can ask them to open a forum, etc.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>The addressees of the task are defined by the combination of language version and group.</p>
