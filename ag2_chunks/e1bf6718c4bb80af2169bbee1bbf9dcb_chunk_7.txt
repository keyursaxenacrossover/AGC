<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Whether the participants fulfill internal quotas can only be checked when there are values for all required variables, i.e. in the course of the survey. For reasons of performance, this check will not be done automatically after each questionnaire page, but only after a page that you have tagged accordingly. The Figure below shows a sample questionnaire. On the page marked with a Q icon, the internal quota are checked.</p>

<p>You should select a page that all participants will have to view, i.e. it should not be located in a filter-branch, for example.</p>
