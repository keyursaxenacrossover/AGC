<p>You can now display the quota allocation for the quota you have created and compare the target values with the actual values.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the line with the quota you have created, click on the symbol Show cell values.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21014812870418"><br>The quota allocation is displayed immediately. Cells for which the quota has been met are displayed in green. If the quota has not been met, the corresponding cell is displayed in red. In the example below, you can see at a glance that you need to recruit both female and male participants for the age range 30-40, male participants for the age range 40-50, and female participants for the age range 20-30. The other segments are sufficiently staffed.</p>
