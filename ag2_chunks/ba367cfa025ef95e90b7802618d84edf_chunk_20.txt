<h3 id="tags" class="sc-eNNmBn lmEGgd wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Tags</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Discussion or user-generated content can be tagged. Tags can be used in posts in the exterior portal view for bottom-up classification, e. g. describing, marking, or relating. All panelists can create tags for posts (discussions, comments, or replies) they create. These tags will start with a hashtag (#) immediately followed by a word or unspaced phrase. Tags created by panelists will be listed in the <strong>Tags</strong> tab where they can be monitored and maintained. New tags can also be added within the <strong>Tags</strong> tab which will also appear in the type-ahead function for panelists in the exterior view, as soon as they start tagging, i. e. as soon as the hashtag (#) is entered. Tags are configured to begin with a lower-case letter and are sorted automatically in either ascending or descending order (as selected).</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li><span style="color: #091e42;">The figure in the green box shows the usage of the tag.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #091e42;"><span style="color: #333333;">You can maintain tags for both blocked and allowed content.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><span style="color: #091e42;">A tag can be blocked by clicking on the </span>Block tag<span style="color: #091e42;"> icon. A blocked tag can be unblocked (switched to state allowed) in the same way. </span>Create blocked tags to prevent undesirable tags from being used in content created by your portal‘s panelists.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Information</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The panelists in your portal will still be able to tag a blocked word, however, it will not appear as a tag and therefore cannot be tracked to the content.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">A blocked tag is indicated by a red icon, whereas a tag that is allowed will feature the same icon in a gray color. Depending on the state of the tag, the icon will either block or unblock a tag.</p>

Topics and Subtopics created here can be used in various contents on the exterior view of the portal, such as shouts or discussions. Topics and subtopics will be assigned during the creation of the content. If a subtopic is assigned, the superior topic will not be displayed.</span></p>
