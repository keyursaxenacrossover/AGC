<li>Set all or selected focus persons to another status: Participant administration → {Selected wave} → "Actions" drop-down list.</li>
<li>Change the status of a single focus person: Participant administration → {Selected wave} → Edit focus person → Process information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Automatically:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Set all participants of a specific wave to another status.</li>
<li>Set participants of a specific wave with specific statuses to another status.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01J3DA86Y0SHXDKTN8Q55A7X4Z">Automating Status Changes</h3>

</ol>
<p><strong>Using Statuses for Access Control</strong><br>During report definition, specify the status participants must have to download the report. Access to data and features in the feedback center depends on participants' statuses.</p>
<h2 id="setting_up_feedback_center">Setting up and Configuring the Feedback Center</h2>
<p>Multi-source feedback includes a default feedback center, which can serve as a central login for participants or a download platform, depending on the feedback process.</p>
<ul>
<li>TIVIAN typically sets up and configures the feedback center.</li>
<li>Custom feedback processes often require special programming, which TIVIAN offers for a fee.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863">FAQ</h1>
<h3 id="faq_1">What is the purpose of feedback roles?</h3>
<p>Feedback roles define the functions and access rights of different participants in the feedback process, such as self-assessment, superior, direct reports, and peers.</p>
<h3 id="faq_2">How can I automate status changes in the feedback process?</h3>
<p>You can set up automated status changes at predefined dates using the "Define status change" feature in the Wave settings of the Participant administration menu.</p>
<h3 id="faq_3">What are report groups and why are they useful?</h3>
