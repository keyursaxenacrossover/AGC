<p>Often you need to be able to select specific participant groups in a targeted manner, e.g. to successively send invitation mails to the various departments of a company or to be able to split according to particular characteristics such as customer type, for expample, in the evaluation process. Consider precisely which subsets you will need in the course of the project and in the evaluation process and how they can be optimally represented in the participant administration. Then create the additional required variables.</p>
