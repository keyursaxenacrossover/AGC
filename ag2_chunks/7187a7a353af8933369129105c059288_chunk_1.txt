<h2 id="project-test" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Project test</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The<strong> Project test</strong> function, located in the <strong>Test and Validation</strong> menu, makes it easier for you to test the setting of the filter by automatically simulating a large number of test sessions. The resulting statistics make it easy to detect setting problems with filters and internal quotas. The following explains the usage options offered by this function:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Producing test data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interpreting test data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deleting test data</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="producing-test-data" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Producing test data</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">After you have finished your questionnaire, open the <strong>Test and Validation</strong> → <strong>Project test</strong> menu. This will open the entry page of the <strong>Project test</strong> menu which provides an overview of the filters and variables used in the project. Click on the<strong> Produce test data</strong> tab and enter the conditions for the automatically generated<br>test runs:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>In the “Number of interviews to create” field, enter the number of questionnaire sessions that are to be automatically generated. The advisable number of sessions depends on the complexity of the project and the robustness of the server. On the one hand, high numbers of sessions (in the hundreds) deliver more meaningful results. On the other hand, projects with a complex filter structure can cause a considerable server load even with one hundred sessions. Before you enter a larger number of times participated, you should therefore make sure that there is no survey with a high number of participants running at the same time on the same installation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>In the second field, you can specify the “Maximum number of pages sent per session”. The number entered should be greater than 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the “Delete test data before execution?” option is enabled, data generated in preliminary test runs or automatically generated test participants are deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Personalized survey” project type only: If the “Use copies of existing participants?” option is enabled, EFS will use existing participants, with disposition codes lower than 20, as template for creating new test participants and will loop sequentially through them until the specified amount of interviews has been created. This function allows you to test surveys, where e.g. filters and other conditions are accessing specific participant variables for routing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the project contains numeric URL parameters, you can specify individual values or number ranges for them. Please note that “Project test” does not support nonnumeric URL parameters. With projects containing such parameters, a “Project test” must be run before the URL parameters are configured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the project contains triggers, you can choose separately whether these may be activated during the project test. Before activating the trigger test function, make sure that this cannot inadvertently trigger infinite loops or the bulk dispatch of mails. Usually, however, a manual test is more advisable for checking the functionality of triggers than using the automatic project test.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Please note that EFS does not generate test data for the <em>User-defined (911)</em> question type and all other question types that are based on it, namely <em>Audio player (911), Video player (911), Slider (numbers) (911), and LUA question type (911)</em>.</p>
<h3 id="routing-statistics" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Routing statistics</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The routing statistics are located on the <strong>Routing Statistics</strong> tab. The following guiding questions will help you to interpret them. After the test run, first check whether the number of sessions completed (disposition code 31, 32) equals the number of times participated you originally entered. To do so, open the<strong> Routing statistics</strong> tab and click on the <strong>Evaluate complete data records only</strong> link.</p>
