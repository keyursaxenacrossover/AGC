<h3 id="header-5">New import tool</h3>
<p>One of the great features of EFS is the ability to import projects and data, helping you to test new versions of surveys, or just migrate to new installations. But some projects can be huge, so you don’t want to hang around waiting for an import to complete. Now, on enabled installations, you can tick off whether you want to be notified as soon as the import is finished. Contact us to use this and other queued features. In addition, in personalised projects, you have a second tap under the menu item “Result import”: <strong>Data migration</strong>. There you select the projects you want to import (you must have access to this project). You can only import projects within in the same installation. The import is then queued to improve performance and free up your time.</p>
<p><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998298552338" alt="Migrate data.png"></p>
<p>In the lower area, you can check on the status of all your imports. The following fields are available to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Status</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Created</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finished uploads</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each import is automatically removed from the list after three days. You can also manually remove the imports.</p>
<p><strong>Coping with projects with huge amount of data</strong></p>
<p>The import process can take time for very large projects. Now, you will be able to see projects that are still in the process of being imported / copied in the normal project overview page.</p>
<p>Projects that have not yet been completely imported or copied can only be selected in the project overview if they have been created completely and without errors. Until completion, these projects are only visible, but not selectable. If an error occurs while copying a project, the project can be deleted after twenty minutes.</p>
<h3 id="header-6">New question type: People selection</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to give survey respondents a quick and easy way of selecting a person from a list. For instance, if you want employees to choose someone from their organization to give recognition to, like a high-five or a shout out. In EFS this has always possible, but required some complex setup and integration. Now, we’ve made it really simple, with a brand-new question type!</p>
<p>This gives survey respondents direct accurate access to other people in the Panel during a survey. Respondents can search for people by first name, last name and e-mail address.</p>
<p><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998342539154" alt="Options.png"></p>
<p>In the Options section of this question type, you configure the following settings: Select a panel group to be used as the source group (the panelists that are displayed in the questionnaire view are taken from this group). Enter placeholder text and a value in relation to the list size, i.e. how many panelists are to be displayed via the drop-down list. The maximum value is 100.</p>
<p><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998330391058" alt="People selection.png"></p>
<p>Please note that for panelists to appear in the search results, the options "Show profile to others", "First name", "Last name" and “E-mail address” must be ticked in the panelist administration.</p>

<h3 id="header-10">The redesign of the<em> Report list</em>
</h3>
<p>The <em>Report list</em> page module has been redesigned to improve usability and match the same design as other Portal modules, such as the <em>Portal invitation</em> module. It’s also been updated to provide a larger amount of generated reports for download. In the module setting, you can select which projects of the <em>Employee survey</em> type you want to offer for selection.</p>
<p><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998313439890" alt="Reports.png"></p>
<p>In the external view of the module, the released ES projects are then available to you in a drop-down list so that you can select them individually to download the reports available for each project. We’ve also greatly improved the filter options so it’s easier to find the right reports, quickly. In addition to the name or meta name of the units, you have two further filter functions by clicking on the filter icon: File type and language. If you do not select an ES project from the drop-down list, the project with the latest field phase end time is displayed first.</p>
