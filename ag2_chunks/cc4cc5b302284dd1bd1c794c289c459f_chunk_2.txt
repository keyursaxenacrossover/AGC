</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Select the appropriate main folder. By default, this is set to the “Default” folder.</p>

</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Editing folders</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Find the desired folder in the project list and click on the <strong>Further Actions</strong> icon. (You need write rights for <em>create_project_cat</em> to see this icon.) The following editing options will appear in a popup window:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p><strong>Delete folder</strong>: This link appears only when the folder is empty and is used to delete the folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Edit folder</strong>: Through this link, you can edit the properties of the folder.</p>
</li>
<li>

</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Moving folders</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">It is possible to move folders, including their projects and subfolders, to another position in the hierarchy. To achieve this, use the<strong> Edit</strong> <strong>folder</strong> button to open the dialog. In the drop-down list “Put folder below”, select the new parent folder. Then, confirm with <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">When moving folders, please mind that the folder structure is restricted to three levels. Therefore, the list of potential target folders contains only folders below which your folder and its subfolders fit.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Ordering projects into folders</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">When sorting projects into other folders, you can choose between two possibilities:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>If you want to resort to only one project, open the Project Properties dialog (via the <strong>Change</strong> link in the “Project Type” field of the Survey menu). In the “Put the projects in folder” field, select the appropriate folder and confirm by clicking on <strong>Change</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to move several projects into the same target folder in one step, start by ticking the “Actions” checkboxes of these projects in the project list. Select the action “Change folder” and confirm by clicking on <strong>Execute</strong>. In the following dialog, you can check your selection. Then, select the appropriate target folder in the drop-down list and confirm by clicking on <strong>Move</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Granting access rights to folders</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Folders located directly under the “Default” folder can be assigned rights during creation.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>If rights are not explicitly defined, then the settings for the Default folder will be assigned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users with read rights for a folder can view the corresponding folder and its subfolders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users with write rights for a folder can edit and delete the corresponding folder and its subfolders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a subfolder, whose main folder has been assigned access rights, is moved to a new main folder with other access rules, then the access rights defined in the original main folder remain intact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="actions" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Actions</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Using the icons in the column “Actions” and the Further Actions icon, you can edit specific projects or access important menus directly. (Please mind: Editing options for forum discussions are currently still limited, if needed please use the familiar options in the <em>Website</em> module.)</p>
