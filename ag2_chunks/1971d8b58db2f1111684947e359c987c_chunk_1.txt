 publicly available (not in a private network).<br>It does not matter if it is a cloud hosted service or an on-premise solution. Due to the fact that every piece of software implements a protocol slightly different, each Identity Provider has to be tested so that we can guarantee that it works.</p><h4 id="header-7"><strong>Is the Identity Provider “X” supported ?</strong></h4><p>These are the providers which have been tested and where the setup is known.  </p><p>Please have a look at the <ac:link ac:card-appearance="inline"><ri:page ri:content-title="List of tested Identity Providers" ri:version-at-save="4"></ri:page><ac:link-body>List of tested Identity Providers</ac:link-body></ac:link>.</p><h4 id="header-8"><strong>What to do if the Identity Provider is not tested yet ?</strong></h4><p>Not tested does not mean not working. Please contact 2nd level support or the IAM team to find out if an integration is possible or not.</p><h4 id="header-9"><strong>How is an Identity Provider tested ?</strong></h4><p>Identity Providers are tested by testing out the login to Okta via the Identity Provider. Testing an Identity Provider does not require Tivian Access to be activated in EFS. The integration can be tested only with Okta and does not impact any business.<br><strong><u>Please note</u></strong>: In order to successfully test an Identity Provider, Tivian needs at least access to a test user present in the Identity Provider.</p><h4 id="header-10"><strong>How long does it take to setup an Identity Provider ?</strong></h4><p>This depends on the case. In case all information is provided by the customer it could only take a few minutes. In case some information is missing or the integration is not working some interaction is required with the customer (which may take some time depending on how the communication is handled).</p><h4 id="header-11"><strong>Do you support Social Identity Providers ?</strong></h4><p>As part of the 19.5 EFS Winter release, we do not support social Identity Providers.</p><h4 id="header-12"><strong>A client of mine offers SAML and OpenID Connect at their Identity Provider - what should I choose?</strong></h4><p>see <ac:link ac:card-appearance="inline"><ri:page ri:content-title="Identity Providers" ri:version-at-save="1"></ri:page><ac:link-body>Identity Providers</ac:link-body></ac:link> </p><p>OpenID Connect is the preferred standard but SAML is also possible. If both are offered choose OpenID Connect.</p><h4 id="header-13"><strong>Can I set up multiple Identity Providers for a client at the same time ?</strong></h4><p>Yes, multiple Identity Providers can be configured in Okta. The identity provider where the user has to authenticate is chosen based on the email address (domain) the user provided.</p><p>E.g: <a href="mailto:user@coca-cola.com">user@red-soda.com</a> → Authenticates at the US Employee Identity Provider from the red soda company</p><p><a href="mailto:user@red-soda.de">user@red-soda.de</a> → Authenticates at the DE Employee Identity Provider from the red soda company</p><h4 id="header-14"><strong>My current installation has an Identity Provider (IdP) enabled and the IdP ID is set. Thus I am not able to login to the clients IdP - How can I login to that installation?</strong></h4><p>The IdP ID directly redirect the a user to the respective Identity Provider. But you can create a request on your own to navigate to Okta without the IdP ID. The easiest way to achieve that is by looking at the network traffic in your browser (see <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network">https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network</a>).</p><p>There will be a request to access.questback.com ending with /authorize in the path part of the URL. Just copy that request and remove the idp_id from the search parameters. This will bring you to the Okta without the IdP ID. Then you can login as normal by providing your email address.</p><p>Another way is to navigate to <a href="https://access.questback.com">https://access.questback.com</a> and login there. After successfull login get navigate to the installation of choice. You should be logged in immediately (for portals you will have to click sign-in)</p><p></p>
