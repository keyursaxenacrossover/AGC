<p><strong>***</strong> If an application corresponds with an EFS installation which is configured for many different domain-aliases, for each such alias the Login Redirect URI / Logout Redirect URI have to be entered manually in OKTA. In case of portal-specific applications the redirect URI will be configured for each domain-alias registered in EFS (Options / Domains) at creation or edit application. The migration script offers an additional option to update all portal-specific applications to get their redirect links up-to-date.</p>
