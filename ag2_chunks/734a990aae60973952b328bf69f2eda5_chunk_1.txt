ysiwyg-text-align-justify">To learn how to draw a sample in practice, please proceed as follows:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Create a panel survey. Make sure that you use the “Panel survey” project type, which is only available for <em>EFS Panel</em> installations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Sample</strong> menu, click on the<strong> Create Sample</strong> button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter a title and description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirm by clicking on <strong>Submit</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The edit dialog of the new sample is opened. The <strong>Overview</strong> tab contains basic information about the new sample. Further tabs contain various settings and editing functions. However, it is not yet possible to select all tabs.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Open the <strong>Define Basic Set</strong> tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the top section of the tab, you specify which panel group shall form the basic set for drawing the sample. For detailed explanations of the various options.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, select the group category and then the panel group from which you want to draw the sample.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally, you can use grouping filters and capacity filters to restrict the basic set further.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally, you can restrict the sample to panelists with specific panel statuses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, a maximum number of participants can be defined. Please note: this is only recommendable if you do not use stratification. If the basic set is narrowed down unnecessarily from the beginning, it might not be possible to reach the target values that are explicitly specified during the stratification process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>The “Extended settings” allow us to further narrow the sample. For example, you can specify how many surveys the members of the new groups must have participated in or how many bonus points they must have. For detailed explanations of the various options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the “Choose the projects...” section, you can optionally exclude the participants of specific projects from the sample draw. To do so, tick the “Exclude” checkbox after the desired project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After specifying all criteria, click on the <strong>Test filter</strong> button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will first test-create the sample. A bar will indicate whether panelists meet the conditions and how many of them do. Furthermore, in addition to the <strong>Test filter </strong>button, you will now see the <strong>Activate filter</strong> button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can make further changes to the filter conditions and test them by clicking on <strong>Test Filter</strong> until the result is to your liking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After that, click on the <strong>Activate filter</strong> button.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"> </p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>The <strong>Overview</strong> tab now contains information on the size of the new sample. The sample shown in the figure comprises 13 participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally, you can define the distribution of certain attributes within the sample in detail on the <strong>Stratification</strong> tab. This option will only be available until you have created the sample by activating the <strong>Draw sample</strong> function on the following tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After you have applied all desired filter criteria to the members of the new sample and also - if stratification is required - performed all necessary stratifications, open the <strong>Draw sample</strong> tab. Click the <strong>Draw sample</strong> button: The sample will now be drawn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the sample has been drawn, the <strong>Define basic set</strong>, <strong>Stratification,</strong> and <strong>Draw sample</strong> tabs are disabled, and the <strong>Statistics</strong>, <strong>View tester list</strong>, <strong>Sample contents</strong>, <strong>Inform, </strong>and <strong>Remind again</strong> tabs are activated.</p>
