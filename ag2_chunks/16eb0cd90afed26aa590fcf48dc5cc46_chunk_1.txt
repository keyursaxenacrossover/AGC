<h2 id="viewing-archived-mails" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Viewing Archived Mails</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Most of the emails sent from <em>EFS</em> are archived and can be viewed for six months:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Personalized surveys, employee surveys, multi-source feedback, panel surveys, and master data surveys feature an overview of all sent emails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In personalized surveys, employee surveys, and multi-source feedback, the mails are listed in the detailed view of the respective participant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In panel and master data surveys, the mails are listed on the Contacts by System mail tab in the detail view of the respective panelist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the appropriate rights you can view all project-specific mail processes of the installation in a centralized manner</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In the long run, the data volumes involved in the sending of emails will put an unnecessary strain on the installation’s performance. Once the project is over, the archived emails are usually not needed ever again. The mail archives will therefore be cleaned automatically at regular intervals: Archived mail will be deleted six months after dispatch (depending on the size of the installation this may be executed earlier).</p>
