<p>If you allow the panelists to upload files, you can define the maximum file size in this field.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">As a moderator, you normally have a moderator or test account that allows you to use the same functions on the website as the panelists. For the most part, however, you will be working from the admin area: There you have further-reaching access rights - for example, you can still upload files when the panelists are not allowed to do so - and various moderation functions are available.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Files of panelists should not be deleted or changed subsequently without good reason. Use your edit options sparingly and observe the netiquette.</p>
