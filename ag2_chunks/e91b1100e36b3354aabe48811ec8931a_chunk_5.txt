<h2 id="panelist-ratings" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Panelist Ratings</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">A typical feature of community sites is the rating of other participants. The participants show sympathy and praise for each other by awarding points or other units of some social currency. EFS Panel allows you to implement such participant ratings easily and without additional programming efforts:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>A new rating function allows panelists to rate other panelists.</li>
<li>The social currency of the EFS Panel is internally referred to as “points”. When using this feature on your website, you may use a completely different name, of course. Unlike bonus points (the currency of EFS Panel’s incentive system) these “social” points only have virtual value.</li>
<li>You define how many points a panelist may award to others. Dedicated master data are used to log how many points a panelist has left to award, how many he has received from others, and how often he has been awarded any points.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can use panelist rating in a variety of scenarios:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>The participants can show sympathy and praise for each other.</li>
<li>In self-administered communities, the mutual rating of participants can be used as an indirect means for steering group behavior and disciplining participants.</li>
<li>A moderator running a community could reserve the right to award points, e.g. to honor particularly active panelists.</li>
<li>You can allocate a fixed number of points to every new panelist, which they are free to award to other panelists. Or you can allocate points only to active or very experienced panelists.</li>
</ul>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Three master data variables of the integer type are required for logging the results of the awarding process:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>A master data variable containing the number of points left for a panelist to award. In the standard panel, this variable is called m_starcredit.</li>
<li>A master data variable containing the number of points a panelist has received from other panelists. In the standard panel, this variable is called m_starsreceived.</li>
<li>A master data variable containing the number of awards to a panelist, i.e. every time the panelist receives points the value of this variable is increased by 1. In the standard panel, this variable is called m_starcount.</li>
