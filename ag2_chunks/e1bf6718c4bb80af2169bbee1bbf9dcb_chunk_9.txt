<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>quota: This variable contains the ID of the allocated quota (i.e. the quota selected via allocation mode). It is used to screen out unsuitable participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>quota_assignment: This variable contains the IDs of all quotas in which the respective participant has been counted. It may help with the evaluation if you have activated option 3, for example, and thus allocated participants to all matching open quotas. In this case, “quota” will contain only the quota selected via allocation mode. “quota_assignment” will contain all the quotas to which the participant has been allocated, i.e. it allows you to understand exactly how the allocation figures are generated. Please bear in mind that “quota_assignment” cannot be used for filtering and other routing processes.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Under certain circumstances, it may be necessary to subsequently increase the quota size during the field phase. In projects with a preset pool of participants (personalized survey, panel and master data surveys), this is problematic if external quota is used, the option to reject participantts on survey start is activated and one of the external quotas has already been closed. That is because, in this case, all respondents who have not yet participated but fall under the quota that has already been closed are automatically set to the “Quota closed” status.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In projects that use external quotas exclusively, it is possible to reactivate the respondents in such a case, thus allowing them to participate. To do so, increase the quota size, change the status to “active”, and confirm by clicking on<strong> Change</strong>. After that, you can choose for which of the changed quotas the participants are to be reactivated. After you have confirmed by clicking on <strong>Submit</strong>, the participant’s status is changed to “active”.</p>
