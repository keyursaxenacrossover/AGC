<h1 id="h_01J4V332RC699PMC6PCX8AF5JR">Portal Module Overview</h1>
<p>Portals offer new ways to interact with your panelists, forming a community and collecting feedback in various ways, may it be through discussions between panelists or by taking part in surveys directly from a portal‘s interface. Qualification of survey results or the joint development of survey topics are easily feasible for each survey project.</p>

<li><em>To <a href="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/21894542359442-How-to-Activate-New-Features-in-EFS">enable the portal module</a>, you must have the people module activated. However, the people module can be enabled without the portal module.</em></li>
<li><em>You won't need to set up a new portal for customers—Professional Services handles that. Any issues related to the portal's Look and Feel should be directed to Professional Services. Customer Support assists with core feature issues (e.g., login problems, navigation) and how-to questions.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Portals offer a range of modules designed to enhance user engagement, facilitate feedback collection, and streamline communication within organizations.</p>

<h1 id="01J4VDSJH6V1XDHW42ETWJ0RP5">Website Module Overview</h1>
<p>The panel website (or websites) is created and maintained via a content management system that is integrated into EFS Panel. The functions available on the website, such as registration and forms for contact e-mails, are integrated into the panel management software.</p>
<p><strong><em>Please note:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The website module is already enabled when the People module is enabled (both <a href="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/21894542359442-How-to-Activate-New-Features-in-EFS">enabled using the 'Panel' module</a>).</em></li>
<li><em>Websites are heavily customized, and the setup is done by either Professional Service or Customers themselves. Central Support can help with how-to issues and core function issues.</em></li>
</ul>
