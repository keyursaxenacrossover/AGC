<h3 id="header-3">The export queue</h3>
<p>As of the winter release, an export queue is available as an option, which helps to ease the workload especially on installations on which large projects have been set up. Using the two new buttons, + New export task and + Export immediate, which you will find in the “Survey menu” under “Export”, you can specify whether an export is to be made available directly for download or whether it is to be put in a queue. While the button for immediate export triggers the usual procedure with a known result, the click on the queue button relieves the system and offers further advantages for you.</p>

<p>Users no longer have to stay on the page until the export is available, but can continue their work with EFS during generation and are informed about the completion by means of the notification icon in the module bar of EFS. The export is also available for download for three days.</p>

<p>You only have to deviate slightly from the usual procedure by assigning a name to the exports to be queued. As soon as the exports are listed, they appear in a table and have the status “In process”. Once the exports have been successfully generated, download them by clicking on the download icon.</p>
<p>The feature must be enabled by support.</p>
<h3 id="header-5">New question type: Autocomplete</h3>
<p>This type of question allows you to provide potential answer options, from which up to ten choices are presented as suggestions based on the autocompletion of what is being typed into the input line by the user. The suggestions are shown in the list of a drop-down box in alphabetical order. They can also be called up by clicking on the drop down arrow.</p>

<p>To use this type of questions with the advantages described above, upload a CSV file with the answer options to the media library. You can download an example file from the questionnaire editor.</p>
