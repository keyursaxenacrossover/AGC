<h2 id="linking-from-forum-posts-to-surveys" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Linking from Forum Posts to Surveys</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Good community moderators keep switching between different methods of communication and surveys. For example, ideas developed during brainstorming in the forum may be tested with a quantitative survey of a larger number of participants. Afterward, interesting comments from the survey will be played back to the community and discussed in the forum. To achieve smoother transitions between different survey methods, a dedicated function allows moderators to insert direct access codes for panel surveys in their forum posts.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>When you prepare your moderator post in the admin area, you will find an <strong>Insert survey link</strong> button above the entry form. Clicking on this button will prompt a window where you can select the desired survey. The syntax for the link will then be inserted into your post automatically.</li>
<li>If a panelist belonging to an active sample of this survey reads your post, he will see his personal clickable authentication link.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assigning-bonus-points" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Assigning Bonus Points</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In many communities, bonus points are awarded for participation in forum discussions. From EFS 10.4, the bonus points can be awarded automatically. But manual, focused allocations are possible as well.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Assigning bonus points</strong></p>
<ol class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>To assign points, click on the <strong>Assign bonus points</strong> icon in the overview.</li>
<li>Fill in the form.</li>
<li>Confirm by clicking on <strong>Check</strong>.</li>
<li>The software then checks how many panelists the specified criteria apply to and how many bonus points will be assigned if you proceed.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Assign Points</strong> to trigger the assignment of points.</li>
</ol>
