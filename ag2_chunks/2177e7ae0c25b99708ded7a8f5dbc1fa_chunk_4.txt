<h3 id="overview-of-the-translation-process" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Overview of the translation process</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Clicking on the <strong>Questionnaire editor → Language editor → Text elements</strong> menu item will take you to the overview of translation to-dos. Here, you can see where there are still untranslated text elements in your questionnaire.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>All text elements in the text element editor that have been filled in the default language should be filled in the additional languages, too. I.e. the pages of the default language will always be marked <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Until all the text elements of an additional language have been completed in the text element editor, the table will output the <strong>Edit</strong> message for the respective page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once all the text elements of a language have been completed, the table will output<br>the <strong>OK</strong> message for the respective page.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can click on the <strong>OK</strong> and <strong>Edit</strong> messages and switch directly to the appropriate page of the text element editor, the functions of which will be described below. Once you have configured this according to the instructions given in the next section, you can start entering the translated text elements.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Please note that the list of translation to-dos will only indicate whether or not a text element is filled with text – it is not possible to check automatically whether the text is in the correct language and has been translated correctly.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Also, this list does not indicate whether survey messages and wildcards have already been translated or whether translated logos or form elements have been uploaded.</p>
<h3 id="editing-text-elements" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Editing text elements</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The text element editor is structured as follows:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>The text elements of the questionnaire page displayed will be grouped by questions and listed in the order in which they appear in the finished questionnaire. The type of the respective text element (“Question text”, “Item text”, etc.) will be displayed in the “Element” column.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The middle column of the text element editor contains the text elements of the default language, i.e. the texts that you can also, as usual, enter and view via the questionnaire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the other columns, the text elements of the selected page will be entered for all other languages. They can be changed as desired (for information on how to open the text elements of another language or all available languages, see the following section, “Configuring the language element editor”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By clicking on the <strong>Preview</strong> icon, you can open the preview of the questionnaire in the respective language.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can change the text elements both in the default language as well as in the other language(s) shown. After you have finished, you must save your changes by clicking on <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">When saving, however, only those changes containing a string will be transferred to the language table. Empty strings will be ignored. Fields of the language table that do not have an entry will show the text for the default language.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If the desired survey language should be coded with character sets other than the international character set UTF-8, then you should set up the suitable character sets.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-the-text-element-editor" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Configuring the text element editor</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Using the <strong>View</strong> function you will be able to edit the display of the language element editor.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>You can change the size of the input fields. Both the number of rows and the number of characters per row can be modified. By default, each input field has three rows and is 40 characters wide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can select languages for editing. By default, when you open the language element editor for the first time, it will display the first language that was created. For projects in three to four languages, it is advisable to display the text elements in all languages simultaneously. By contrast, for projects with a dozen or more languages, it may be more advisable not to show all the languages simultaneously but to edit the respective text elements successively or in groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you have completed the text elements on one questionnaire page, you can click on the <strong>Arrow</strong> icons in the top right corner of the window to navigate to the text elements of the previous or next questionnaire page.</p>
