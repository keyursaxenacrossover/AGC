<h2 id="access-permissions-for-panel-groups"><strong>Access Permissions for Panel Groups</strong></h2>
</div>
<p>On the sub-navigation field <strong>Settings</strong> you will find the tab <strong>Access permissions</strong>. You use this to restrict access to the dashboards to specific panel groups, as you do in <em>MySight.</em></p>
<ul class="ak-ul">
<li>
<p>In the area "Access permission for panel groups, you use the drop-down list to select "Group members".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then click on the currently appearing button <strong>+ Panel group</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You use another drop-down list to select the panel group you want to allow access to the dashboards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must confirm your choice with the green check mark. You reject them with <strong>X</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, you can give multiple panel groups access to the dashboards by selecting another group from the second drop-down list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the confirmation click this group will be added to your selection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You repeat this process until all groups that you want to grant access to have been included in the selection.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The groups that you have granted access to the dashboards are displayed by mouseover using the icon on the portal tile. By clicking on the icon, you can jump to the sub-navigation field <strong>Settings</strong> under the tab <strong>Access permissions</strong>. </p>

<p>Do not deny access to the panel groups that you allow within the <em>MySight</em> module to access from the exterior view of <em>Portals</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="fabric-editor-block-mark sc-ixltIz dsUKKC">
<h2 id="navigation"><strong>Navigation</strong></h2>
</div>
<p>The sub-navigation field <strong>Navigation</strong> contains two additional tabs relevant to the integration of the <em>MySight</em> module: <strong>Main navigation</strong> and <strong>Tab navigation</strong>. You only add pages to the user navigation that offer the panellist user-oriented functions such as your own profile or logout - not the page with the integrated <em>MySight</em> module.</p>
<p>The main navigation, which is accessed via the menu on the right-hand side of the exterior view of <em>Portals,</em> adds a page by clicking <strong>+ Page</strong> and selecting the corresponding page from the drop-down list that appears and confirming your choice with the green tick. You use the <strong>X</strong> to discard them. Using the Drag &amp; Drop, you can still sort the order of the pages as they should appear in the overlay menu of the external portal view.</p>
<p>You use the Tab navigation to create the page selected in the exterior view of <em>Portals</em> as a tab, which allows you to switch between pages more quickly. Add the newly created page with the <em>MySight</em> module, as well as an existing standard or target the page that has been equipped with the <em>MySight</em> module, as a tab.</p>
<ul class="ak-ul">
<li>
<p>You click on <strong>+ Page</strong> and select the desired page from the drop-down list</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use drag &amp; drop to control the order of the tabs and how they are to be arranged in the exterior view.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The integration has thus been successful.</p>

<p>In the Portals menu <strong>Guides </strong>you can also create a link to the MySight module page within your portal. You select a MySight project, a workbook and a view. The dashboard you display through the MySight pages module does not have to be the same as the one offered through <em>Guides</em>. To start your guide, publish it.</p>
