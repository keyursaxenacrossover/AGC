<h2 id="referencing-page-modules-from-multiple-pages" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Referencing Page Modules from Multiple Pages</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">By creating appropriate page modules, you can easily compile the desired contents and functions for each panel page. However, if an element such as a news list, for example, is to be displayed on multiple pages, creating the respective module on every single page would be very time-consuming. The updating of changes would also involve considerable effort: every copy of the page module would have to be adjusted manually.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Therefore, once you have created a page module, EFS allows you to reference it from other pages as well: the modules are created only once, and changes are made only once, but the contents will be visible on all desired pages.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21014721683602" alt="image-20240115-100004.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In the example shown above, the “Latest News”, the display of the currently logged-in panelists, and the list of blogs are referenced page modules. In the website editor, they are located on a dedicated page “GLOBAL”.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Please note: For many page module types, referencing does not make sense. Therefore the referencing feature is only available for selected page module types. For an up-to-date list, please see the Modules from Other Pages tab in the editing dialog of the respective page.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Additional modules can be made available for reference. If this is necessary, please contact support.</p>
<h3 id="work-steps" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Work Steps</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Referencing page modules from multiple pages requires three steps:</p>

<li>
<p>Deciding where the global page modules should be placed in the overall structure and modifying the main template accordingly</p>
</li>
