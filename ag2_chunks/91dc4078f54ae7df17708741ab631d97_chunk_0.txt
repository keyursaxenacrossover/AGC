<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Select “Project” from the export menu. You can then store the .gpx file on your computer. Your project is now stored in compressed form as a .gpx file. In order to import this project, you now have to click on “New project” in the new license/account and then switch to the “Import project” tab. Here, you can then upload the .gpx file and thus transfer it to the new license/account.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HGKSMPRT3BXQJ8YJCGX9WNKM">Important Considerations</h2>
<p>When transferring a survey project, keep in mind the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The survey link changes during the import process.</li>
<li>If you have already sent the original link to test users, you have two options:
<ol>
<li>Send the new link to all test users</li>
<li>Keep the old project active to maintain the original link</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863">FAQ</h1>
<h3 id="h_01HGKSMPRT9PAQP4D4ILC5BSQQ">Will my survey responses be transferred with the project?</h3>
<p>This article doesn't specifically address the transfer of survey responses. It's recommended to check with Questback support for information on transferring survey data along with the project.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HGKSMPRT0QBQQ5E5JMD6CTRR">Can I transfer a project between different versions of Questback?</h3>
<p>The guide doesn't mention version compatibility. It's best to ensure both the source and destination accounts are using compatible versions of Questback before attempting a transfer.</p>
