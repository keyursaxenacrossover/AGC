 Library</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Individual or several files can be downloaded. For this purpose, a <strong>Download</strong> icon is available on every level of the category structure on the<strong> Current Project</strong> and<strong> Common library</strong> tabs. If you select the desired files and click this icon, a zip file will be generated that contains the content of the current folder including its subfolders. You can save this file locally to a PC, open it, and then view or edit the images.</p>

<p>When working in the installation-wide media library, in particular, take care to select only reasonable amounts of data for download, i.e. less than 10 MB and not more than 30 files. Otherwise, the download process can affect the performance of the <em>EFS</em> installation.</p>

</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Protecting images</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Customers running product or cover tests frequently ask for better protection against illegal copying and screenshotting of their content. A dedicated image protection feature makes storing or screenshotting of images considerably more difficult.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>In the questionnaire, participants will see only the silhouette and outline of the projected image, plus an instruction for display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the participants press the key combination specified in the instruction, the image will be displayed. (They have to keep the blank key pressed and click on the image with the left key of the mouse pointer.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">For technical reasons, it is not possible to prevent participants from taking screenshots or from downloading the displayed images on their hard disks with absolute reliability. But with the new image protection feature, it is considerably more difficult.</p>
<h2 id="survey-library" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Survey library</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The survey library allows access to readymade sample questionnaires. A set of ready-made English surveys is available from the library. The sample surveys are listed in the menu <strong>Libraries</strong> → <strong>Survey library</strong>. Its interface design is analogous to the media library. Inside the library, the sample questionnaires are read-only.</p>

In the project template field, select the desired library survey via the <strong>Magnifying glass</strong> icon. Fill in all other fields as usual.

</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The survey library cannot be used for multi-source feedback.</p>
<h2 id="mail-templates" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Mail templates</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Usually, e-mails are written based on existing mail templates, which are centrally created, edited, and managed in the <strong>Libraries → Mail templates</strong> menu. In the mail form’s “Mail template” drop-down list, you can select one of these templates and upload it by clicking on <strong>Apply mail template</strong>.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">To create a new template, click on the <strong>Manage Mail templates</strong> link. The <strong>Libraries</strong> → <strong>Mail templates</strong> menu, which allows you to create the desired new template, will be opened in a pop-up window.</p>
<h3 id="creating-new-mail-template" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Creating a new mail template</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">To create a new template, click on the button + <strong>New draft</strong> and select the desired option. You have different template types for the Panel website, survey project, and portals. Depending on whether you want to create a template for the Panel website, a survey project, or portals, the available template types also change.</p>
