<p>After a confirmation window, all data for the selected projects will be backed up from the database, compressed into downloadable zip files, and then deleted from the database. The archived projects with their zip files will be listed in the <strong>Projects</strong> →<strong> Archive</strong> menu.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Alternatively, if you want to archive a single project, you can proceed as follows:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Find the project to be archived in the project list and click on the title, to be taken to the <strong>Survey</strong> menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the links in the To-do field until the<strong> Archive</strong> link is displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the<strong> Archive</strong> link.</p>

<p>In the next low traffic period, all data for the project will be backed up from the database, compressed into the downloadable zip file and then deleted from the database. The archived project with the zip file will be listed in the<strong> Archive</strong> submenu.</p>

<h3 id="viewing-downloading-and-deleting-archived-projects" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Viewing, downloading, and deleting archived projects</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can find those archived projects that you’re authorized to access in the <strong>Projects</strong> → <strong>Archive</strong> menu. A search function is available. Furthermore, to improve the overview, the archived projects can be grouped and sorted with the help of a folder system just like the one for projects in the project list. These, however, are two separate hierarchies: The folder system in the archive is set up independently of the folders in the project list.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Using the familiar “Actions” checkboxes and the drop-down list below the table, you can apply the following actions to several projects at once: </p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Change folder: Enables you to move the projects selected into a target folder to be defined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete result data: By clicking on this icon, you can delete the zip file with the result data. Only when you previously saved the zip file locally, is it subsequently possible to upload and reactivate the project with result data. It is not possible to delete projects from the archive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete projects: Allows to remove the projects selected. Please note that the deletion process cannot be reversed. Project and result data from deleted projects can no longer be reconstructed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The following editing functions can be used to edit individual projects:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p><strong>Preview</strong>: You can view the questionnaire of an archived project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Download</strong>: By clicking on this icon you can download and store the zip file locally on your PC. The information contained within this file is not for viewing files outside of the project and therefore you should never try to open the data: They merely serve the purpose of local storage for security reasons. Therefore downloading only makes sense, if you continue to store the project in the archive of the <em>EFS</em> installation so that you can upload the data and reactivate the project later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>File upload</strong>: This icon becomes visible when the zip file with the result data has been deleted (for example in the above figure in the project “Website Check). If the zip file was saved externally, then this icon enables you to upload it again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reactivating</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The downloaded data is not a backup copy of the entire project, and cannot be viewed outside of EFS or recreated using an import function.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Pay careful attention that you upload the correct file, otherwise reactivation of the project will not be possible. Should you upload the wrong zip file, delete it first by clicking on the <strong>Delete</strong> button, and then upload the correct file.</p>
<h3 id="reactivating-archived-projects" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Reactivating archived projects</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">When you click on the Reactivate icon you are given two options:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>reactivate with result data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reactivate without result data</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If the zip file with result data has been deleted, the only option available is “Reactivate without result data”.</
