<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">An individual column is created for each participant variable to be imported.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>We recommend entering the respective column labels in the first row.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Where possible use the name of the respective variable as the label: The software will automatically identify the columns and assign them to the appropriate database fields. If you choose this option, make sure to tick the checkbox “First row includes column labels” in the import dialog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should you deviate from these recommendations, make sure that the first row does not contain any blank spaces or special characters such as dots or umlauts. Otherwise, these will be uniformly replaced with “_”.</p>

How codes that do not yet exist or entries that cannot be interpreted as code are treated depends on the display type and fine-tune settings.</p>
