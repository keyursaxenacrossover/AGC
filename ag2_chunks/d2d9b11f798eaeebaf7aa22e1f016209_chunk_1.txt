<h3 id="faq_what_if_lose_phone">What happens if I lose my phone with the authenticator app?</h3>
<p>If you lose your phone, the process depends on the app you're using. Some apps, like Microsoft Authenticator and Authy, offer cloud backups that allow you to recover your accounts on a new device. However, apps like Google Authenticator don't have this feature, so you'd need to use backup codes or contact EFS support to regain access to your account.</p>
<h3 id="faq_multiple_devices">Can I use an authenticator app on multiple devices?</h3>
<p>Some authenticator apps, like Authy, support multiple devices. Others, like Google Authenticator, are designed for use on a single device. Check the features of your chosen app to see if it supports multiple devices.</p>
<h3 id="faq_browser_addons">Are there browser add-ons for TOTP authentication?</h3>
<p>Yes, there are browser add-ons and extensions that can perform TOTP authentication without requiring a mobile phone. These can be convenient alternatives to mobile apps, especially when using a computer.</p>
