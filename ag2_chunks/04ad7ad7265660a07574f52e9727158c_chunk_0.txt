<h2 id="h_01HGKSMPRT1QJXZ3YJVQ8NKPX2">Why SPSS Truncates Open Questions</h2>
<p>SPSS has a limitation where it cuts off questions after 255 characters. This means that longer open-ended responses may not be fully visible within the SPSS interface.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HGKSMPRT2KGQX0YJHWJP8QXM">Accessing Full Open Question Data</h2>
<p>To access the complete data for open questions, you need to export the data to a CSV file and then view it in a spreadsheet program. Follow these steps:</p>
<h3 id="h_01HGKSMPRT3BXQD1QQXQJNKP4T">Step 1: Export the Data</h3>
<p>Select "Results data" (all data) from the "Export" menu. Choose "CSV" as the format and "Project, open questions only" as the export template.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HGKSMPRT4KGQX0YJHWJP8QXN">Step 2: Edit the CSV File</h3>
<p>Open the resulting CSV file in a spreadsheet program (e.g., Excel). This will allow you to view and edit the full content of the open questions without any character limitations.</p>
