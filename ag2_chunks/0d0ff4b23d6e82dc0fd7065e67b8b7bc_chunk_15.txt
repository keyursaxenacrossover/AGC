<h3 id="chart-types" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Chart types</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><em>EFS Reporting+</em> supports the following chart types:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Simple bar and column charts: These charts are used to represent frequency distributions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stacked bar and column charts: These charts allow you to compare partial and total frequencies for different dimensions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stacked bar and column charts (100 %): The maximum length or height of the bars and columns, respectively, is 100 %. This concise form of representation makes it easier to compare several questions using identical rating scales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pie charts: Pie charts are used when frequencies can be added up to a meaningful total sum that equals 100 %.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Line charts: This chart type is used to represent the results of several waves or progressions over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Radar charts: These charts, which are also called “Spider Web” charts, are used to visualize matrix questions. Please mind: that radar charts are currently not supported yet for contingency tables.</p>
