<h3 id="header-16">Action Trigger</h3>
<p>This trigger creates a new action in the target ES project. A range of conditions and settings defines if an action is created and what content is stored in the action.</p>
<p>The target unit for an action needs to be provided in a variable of the originating survey. If a unit cannot be found, a survey runtime error is thrown and the surveys error notification recipients will be notified.</p>
<p>The surveys wildcards can be used to dynamically fill action planner variables. Conditions can be defined to provide different content based on pre-defined rules. Default fields cannot be removed and must have a value.</p>
