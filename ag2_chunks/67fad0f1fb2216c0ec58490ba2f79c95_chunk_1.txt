<p><strong>Why is a unique group required for each Data Voyager instance?</strong></p>
<p>A unique group ensures that permissions and access controls are specific to the instance, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.</p>
<p><strong>What should I do if I need to set up multiple instances?</strong></p>
<p>Repeat this setup process for each instance, ensuring that each has its own group and Okta application.</p>
<p><strong>What if the client uses multiple domain aliases?</strong></p>
<p>Ensure that all relevant login and logout redirect URIs are added to the application settings for each domain alias.</p>
