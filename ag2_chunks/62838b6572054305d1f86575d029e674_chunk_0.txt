<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSYYE7GMM7DZ0VCKXK" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Information</h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Exchange Teams in EFS Secure Exchange are used to manage access rights for file exchanges.  First, create exchange teams, configure their rights, and assign user teams to these exchange teams. Ensure all involved persons have EFS accounts and are assigned to user teams. If needed, create user accounts and assign them to appropriate teams. Grant access rights based on the required level of access: for the File exchange menu in the EFS Survey admin area, use the ACL right "area_www"; for the separate fm login, use the ACL right "area_fm". If access rights vary within a team, create additional user teams and reassign members as necessary.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">This guide explains how to create and manage these teams, assign user teams, and configure appropriate access rights for different scenarios.</p>
