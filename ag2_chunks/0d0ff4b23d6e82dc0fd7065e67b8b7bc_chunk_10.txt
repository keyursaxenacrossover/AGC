<p>Net participation.</p>
<p>The net participation indicates how many participants have answered a multiple response question, or particular answer options of that question, respectively. Thus, the aggregation shows how many participants have selected at least one answer, and not how many answers have been selected how many times altogether.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can aggregate several related answer options and then have the net participation calculated for this particular aggregation. For each aggregation, the participants will be counted only once</p>
