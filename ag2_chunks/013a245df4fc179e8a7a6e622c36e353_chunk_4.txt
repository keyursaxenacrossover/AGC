 Templates</strong></h3>
<p>Until now, it was not possible to save information about which e-mail template was used to create an e-mail. From now on each e-mail will be provided with an ID generated by the system, which will be listed in the mail report table in the <em>Mail Template</em> column. The ID also acts as a link, allowing you to access the template you are using.</p>

<h3 id="header-26"><strong>Early Complete</strong></h3>
<p>From now on, you can mark the pages of your questionnaire with a special indicator, so that e.g. participants who have answered these questionnaire pages will receive the disposition code <em>completed</em> at the end of the participation period or the deadline set by you. To activate this feature, open the <strong>Project properties</strong> of your PE project and check the option "Early complete support".</p>

<p>If the <em>date_of_expire</em> variable is not set, you can use the <strong>Mark finished after</strong> option to specify a replacement value so that participants receive the disposition code completed at the end of this period, which begins with the last access. In anonymous projects, the <em>Mark finished after</em> option is unavailable, instead the participants are automatically marked as completed after their session expired. To configure a shorter session expiration in anonymous projects, go to Project properties &gt; Login options.</p>
<p>You can also check whether the trigger should be executed on the end page. This means, that even in the case of a short participation without reaching the actual end page of the survey, the triggers placed there will be executed.</p>

<p>In the second step, open the menu item <strong>Page</strong> in the <strong>Questionnaire editor</strong> before clicking<strong> Properties</strong> and activate the option <em>Early complete page</em> in the "Other options" area. In addition, for each page that you mark in this way, you can select a disposition code that participants will receive when they complete that page. Each participant receives the disposition code of the last page he or she has completed, i.e. the page that has been marked this way. You can activate this option for all desired pages of your questionnaire, after the completion of which participants are to be marked for a certain disposition code (chosen by you).</p>
<h3 id="header-27">Information</h3>
<p>This feature is only available for PE and AN projects. By default, it is disabled.</p>
<h3 id="header-28"><strong>Disable Visual Editor in E-mail Template Configuration</strong></h3>
<p>You can now deactivate the visual editor, which is also available to you when creating e-mail templates. If you select this option, you will only have the Source Editor installed, so the risk of damaging the HTML code when switching to the Visual Editor is minimized.</p>
<h3 id="header-29"><strong>Placeholder</strong></h3>
<p>The placeholder <em>#u_guidewave_rater_group#</em> can now also be used in question types that contain the fields "Question text" and "Fill-in instruction". The placeholder is also displayed in the survey according to the survey language if this has been maintained under <strong>Categories</strong> in the <strong>Libraries</strong>. The placeholder can also be used in the subject line as well as in the text of an e-mail template. You can only use this placeholder in survey of PE project that is connected to <em>Guides</em>.</p>
<h3 id="header-30"><strong>Export and Import of all Survey Languages</strong></h3>
<p>Under the menu item <strong>Export/import</strong> of the <strong>Language editor</strong>, the tab<strong> Export/import all languages</strong> is available. You use this to export and import all survey languages. In the <strong>Export</strong> section you will find a <strong>Download</strong> button which you can use to create the export of all survey languages of the selected project. An xslx file is downloaded. The xslx files are project-related and cannot be exchanged between different EFS projects.</p>
<p>The <strong>Import</strong> section allows you to select and import a file. Only xslx files can be uploaded. You can create a report about the changed phrases.</p>
<h3 id="header-31"><strong>Export Survey Data</strong></h3>
<p>The new export format Triple-S v2.0 CSV allows to export very large projects in the Triple-S format and is supported by many current software products.</p>
<h2 id="header-33"><strong>Web Services</strong></h2>
<p>New web services have been developed. As of this winter release, it is possible to change participants and the participations. A service for multilingual templates and participant import is also available.</p>
<h3 id="header-35"><strong>Changing Participants and Participations</strong></h3>
