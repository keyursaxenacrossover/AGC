<h3 id="setting-the-dispatch-date-dispatch-period-and-status-of-e-mails" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Setting the dispatch date, dispatch period, and status of e-mails</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Located below the actual mail form, the “Delivery options” section allows you to set the dispatch date and the dispatch period or to set the status of the mail to “Hold”.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21015414437522" alt="image2019-3-13_11-26-9.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Validate disposition codes before dispatch</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Check the option in order to avoid multiple invitations or reminders to the same participant. The respective mail will now only be sent to participants who are active, and either have not been invited yet, have suspended their survey, or where mail delivery has failed previously.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Set mail status to “Hold”</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If, before sending the e-mails, you want to check their number and content in the mail report, you can tick this checkbox. The emails will then be kept in the queue. Using this option is advisable if, for reasons relating to the organization of work, you have a staff member create the e-mails, but they are not to be sent until released by the project manager.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>When to send: .. : (Time at server = ...)</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Instead of sending the prepared e-mails immediately, you also have the option of choosing a later date. The emails will then be kept in the queue until the sending date. This is advisable, for example, if the invitation to a survey is not to be sent until a certain event has occurred or outside of your office hours. For example, you can prepare the invitation emails for a survey that is scheduled to start on a weekend but have the emails sent automatically only when the pre-set time is reached. This way, you can prevent participants from trying to access the survey before the start of the project.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">A group of drop-down lists in the “When to send” field is available for setting the date and time.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>You can use a calendar, which is opened by clicking on the <strong>Calendar</strong> icon, to set the date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exact time of sending must be specified manually. The current time is displayed on the left below the menu. If you have taken advantage of the possibility to set your local time, this time will be displayed below, in the “Local date” field, to facilitate the conversion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Queued e-mails that have the same dispatch time will be sent in the order in which they were created. Any mails that have been set eight hours ahead due to a previous failed attempt but have an earlier or the same dispatch date will therefore be sent with priority.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>„When to send“ uses the recipient‘s time zone</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Check the option in order to confirm the time of mail dispatch to the recipient‘s individual time zone. A recipient‘s individual time zone is saved within the u_timezone variable. Please note that participants may live in time zones ahead of your own, therefore it may be required to plan in advance.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Setting a dispatch period for dynamic dispatch</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In large surveys, mail dispatch is often organized in waves to avoid server overload. The organization of participants in waves is frequently performed manually: In the participant administration, participants are assigned to the respective waves with specific variables or characteristics. To invite a wave, the project manager then looks for the participants with the appropriate value and manually completes the entire mail dispatching process. With <em>EFS</em>, this is not necessary: Instead of manually organizing the participants in different waves to be processed in daily intervals, you simply specify a time frame within which the mails of your mailing action are to be sent. The system will then divide the total amount of mail into portions to be sent out in even distribution across the specified interval.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You will find the corresponding function in the “Dispatch period for dynamic dispatch” field. Enter the interval in minutes. By default, the field is blank and no distribution is performed.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The dynamic dispatch function does not override the technical limits of mail dispatch: An <em>EFS</em> installation can process a fixed mail volume every 10 minutes. Per default, the maximum volume is 1,000 emails, up to 2,000 emails are possible. If more emails are generated, they will be queued and processed successively
