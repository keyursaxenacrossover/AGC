<h4 id="alias-aname-cname-flattening-non-standard-virtual-record">ALIAS / ANAME / CNAME Flattening (non-standard / virtual-record)</h4>
<p>This record combines the benefits of both a CNAME and an A- / AAAA-Record and is mainly used for, but not limited to, pointing an Apex-Domain to a CDN (Content Delivery Network) or a high available load-balanced setup in AWS.</p>
<p>It is non-standard, meaning there is now official RFC for this (yet), and virtual, meaning that it appears in configuration only and is being presented as a A- / AAAA-Record instead when queried. Also due to it being non-standard there is no official name for it, but it is often called either “ALIAS” or “ANAME” inside the configuration-interface of a DNS-Provider that supports it.</p>
<p>A provider implementing this kind of record, does so by involving a resolving name-server when answering a DNS-Query to get the A- / AAAA-Records of the deposited FQDN, which are then returned in kind (see image below). In practice some form of caching mechanisms are probably also used to prevent DoS-Attacks.</p>

<h4 id="caa">CAA</h4>
<p>Also known as the <strong>Certification Authority Authorization</strong> DNS-Record is intended to provide insight / authorization in issuing Certificates and was specified in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8659">RFC 8659</a>.<br>The basic idea is that a Certificat Authory e.g like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" data-card-appearance="inline">https://letsencrypt.org/</a> which we are using in our productive cloud clusters, has to check for the existince of a CAA record first, before proceeding with issueing a certificate.</p>
<p>Also important to note is, that a CAA Record not only applies domain it sits on, but also “further down the tree”. So if <a href="http://some.example.com">some.example.com</a> does NOT have a CAA record but <a href="http://example.com">example.com</a> has, those Records to apply to <a href="http://some.example.com">some.example.com</a> as well when trying to get a certificate issued for it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">some.example.com IN CAA 0 issue "letsencrypt.org"
example.com IN CAA 0 issuewild "letsencrypt.org"
example.com IN CAA 0 iodef "mailto:some-domain@example.com"</code></pre>
