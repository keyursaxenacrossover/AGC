<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The “Language selection log” section displays important operations within language administration (e.g. creating and deleting languages and changing the default language) in chronological order. Therefore, you can also see here, among other things, who last changed the default language and is thus responsible for unblocking the language selection.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In personalized projects and panel and master data surveys on EFS Panel installations, you can transfer the contents of variables from another project, i.e. if a participant has completed the source project, you can automatically import their answers into the variables of the second project and use them there for filtering, evaluation, and other purposes. Participation is assigned via the participant’s e-mail address.</p>
