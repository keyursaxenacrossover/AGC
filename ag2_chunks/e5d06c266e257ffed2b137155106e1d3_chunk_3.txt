 restructuring of the folder structure, it is now easier for MySight users to understand and use MySight folders in Tableau. Folders are created and the variables are grouped in these folders.</p>
<h3 id="header-24">New table structure</h3>
<p>Now MySight has a five-level table structure with unique labels. The column headers are: QuestionID, QuestionTitle, QuestionSubtitle, ResponseOption and EXT_Variable.</p>
<h3 id="header-25">Grouping filters for the export of the panel data</h3>
<p>In the People module, you can create grouping filters now to filter panel data during export. You use the conditions you have specified. A group does not have to exist. The condition is created under: People -&gt; Groups -&gt; Grouping filters –&gt; Filter conditions. You select the desired grouping filter in the export settings.</p>
<h2 id="header-27">GDPR: The Privacy Assistant</h2>
<h3 id="header-29">Role distribution</h3>
<p>The idea that all the world is a stage where actors have their exits and their entrances, will be in your head from the May 25th, 2018 at the latest, when you will have to act as a data controller. As of this date, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies, which gives the data subject, i.e. the person whose data are processed, some rights. In order to ensure that your data processing complies with this welcome regulation, the Privacy Assistant has been implemented in EFS Survey, which both adds the necessary features to known work steps and adds new steps.</p>
<h3 id="header-30">Create a new project</h3>
<p>The step Create project has been modified for the project types “Anonymous survey”, “Personalized survey” and “Employee survey”. As part of this step, the Privacy Assistant can be activated for each of the three project types. If the check mark for the Assistant is set and the project is created, a new step is necessary to create the questionnaire: the configuration of the privacy consent form. If you want to activate the Privacy Assistant for an existing project, you can also check it subsequently. The layouts Responsive Layout 3 and 2 are supported. The Privacy Assistant is already activated by default to meet the "Privacy by default" requirement.</p>
<p>You can also disable the assistant by unchecking it.</p>
<h3 id="header-31">Subsequent activation of the Privacy Assistant</h3>
<p>Under the "General Options" tab in the project properties, you tick the Privacy Assistant to activate it for existing projects. The Privacy Assistant, which can only be activated subsequently for existing projects, only applies to the surveys that are started after editing and saving the</p>
<p>consent form, for which approval must be given for participation.</p>
<h3 id="header-32">Configuration of the Privacy consent form</h3>
<p>Once the Privacy Assistant has been activated for a new or existing project, the next step is to obtain the<br>consent of informed participants for the data processing. You configure a privavy consent form not only to obtain the consent of the participants, but also to inform them about the most important privacy information such as the name of your company (controller), the contact details, the controller’s representative or the type of personal data and its use.</p>
<p>To configure this page, follow these steps: Use the drop-down list to select a language. The default language of the survey is set by default. You write a welcome message. Placeholders and known text formats can be used for this purpose. Then you can use a template created in the libraries for the consent form. The selection of the templates that are displayed depends on which language you have selected previously. You use the following text field to inform about the purpose of the data processing. No content specification are made to you. Finally, you specify how long the data is retained. You can make your entry in years, month or days. You do not specify an expiry date by ticking "Unlimited" and writing an explanatory text for unlimited data retention. The disposition code 42 is assigned to the participants who do not give their consent.</p>
<h3 id="header-33">Libraries: Create consent form templates</h3>
<p>You do not have to configure the privacy consent form for each project anew. Instead, you create templates in the Libraries, which you use as required when creating a privacy consent form. Pre-filled forms including the most common applications can also be found there, so that you have GDPR-compliant consent forms by means of minor but indispensable adjustments to your project conditions. The configuration is the same as in the questionnaire editor. When you create the consent page in the questionnaire editor you select the language first, so that the selection of the consent form is automatically limited to those with the matching language. Then you assign a name. In the text field, you enter the purpose for which the data is processed. By means of the following fields you inform the participant about the privacy information.</p>
<h3 id="header-34">The flagging of questions and variables as personal data</h3>
<p>The creation of questions and participant variables has also been modified by giving you the<br>option for each question or variable you create: “Flag question as personal data” respectively “Flag as personal data”. In addition to the option of marking questions independently as personal data, question types 141 to 144, i.e. those that have a free text field, are marked as personal data by default. This setting can
