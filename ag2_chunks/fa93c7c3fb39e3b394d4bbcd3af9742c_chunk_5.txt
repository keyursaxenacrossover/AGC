<p>The <em>m_offlineusers </em>master data</p>
<p>This feature is an enhancement of the 'Offline User Scenario', which you know from the 18.3 fall release. If you add panelists with the master data m_offlineusers = 1 in the guide setup, at the end of the guide setup process will generate a PDF that will be sent to the guide initiator containing participation vouchers. In order to mask the dummy e-mail address, this dummy e-mail address is replaced by the placeholder <em>Offline Participant</em> in both the participant list and the search results.</p>
<h3 id="header-14">Displaying the dimensions of the matrix questions</h3>
<p>In order to make the question text of the matrix question types accessible in the Guide setup, the names of the individual dimensions of a matrix question type are now displayed.</p>
<h3 id="header-15">Sending result e-mails</h3>
<p>Under the <strong>Settings</strong> tab of the <strong>Guides</strong> sub-navigation, you will find three radio buttons that you can use to determine to whom the result e-mail is sent automatically after a guide has been ended.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>no one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everyone (manager included)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>guide-initiator</p>
</li>
</ul>
