<p>Optionally, you can allow the panelists to upload files. If at least one file type is marked as “allowed” in this field and a maximum upload file size &gt; 0 is defined in the next field, the entry form for posts and comments will contain a field for the file upload.</p>
<p>Please mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the file types named in the edit dialog are permitted.</li>
<li>For films in “flv” format, EFS provides a player, i.e. they are embedded properly into the post. The display of other video formats depends on the operating system, browser, and the plugins of the panelists.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a moderator, you can upload files to a post via the admin area, regardless of these settings.</p>
