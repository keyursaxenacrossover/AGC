<h2 id="standard_configuration">Standard Configuration</h2>
<p>In the standard configuration of EFS (Enterprise Feedback Suite), Tivian does not save IP addresses together with survey results. This ensures a basic level of privacy for survey respondents.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="special_rights">Special Rights</h2>
<p>There is an exception to the standard configuration. If special rights have been activated, it becomes possible to manually enable the saving of IP addresses on a project-by-project basis. This feature is not enabled by default and requires specific authorization.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="data_logging">Data Logging</h2>
<p>IP addresses are logged in a separate database for troubleshooting and IT-Security purposes. This database log is only accessible to Tivian administrators and is not directly linked to survey results.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="data_linking">Data Linking</h2>
<p>While it is theoretically possible to link an IP address from the database log to a specific survey answer, this process requires considerable effort and is only available for a limited period of time. Due to the significant resources required, this is offered as an additional chargeable service and is exclusively used for prosecuting criminal offenses.</p>
