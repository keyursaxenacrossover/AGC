<p>People combines powerful panel management, a content management system for designing the panel website and the functions of the Enterprise Feedback Suite, the basic platform for performing data collection processes.</p>
<p>You can employ all the tools you already know from EFS in creating, conducting and evaluating online surveys. People is designed to manage panels with over 100,000 participants.</p>
<p>Import interfaces allow you to import participant data from external sources into the panel as a basis for generating the panelist data. Various statistics functions make it easier for panel administrators to control the composition of the panel. You can use criteria you have selected yourself to create subpanels (“groups”) from the overall pool of panel participants. These serve as the basis for drawing samples for individual surveys. Export interfaces allow you to evaluate and further process the data collected (master data, address data, project data, etc.) externally.</p>
