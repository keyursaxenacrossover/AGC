<h3 id="faq_1" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">What is the minimum number of participants required to display return data?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The minimum number of participants required to display return data is 5. This applies to both direct and accumulated returns.</p>
<h3 id="faq_2" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">How does the Remainder Rule affect data display?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The Remainder Rule ensures that even if a unit has 5 or more participants, its data may still be hidden if showing it would allow the calculation of hidden data from other units. This rule is applied to maintain overall anonymity across parallel units.</p>
<h3 id="faq_3" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Can the Anonymity Criterion and Remainder Rule be deactivated?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">While these rules cannot be completely deactivated, there are options to modify their behavior. For example, you can choose whether to include units with a return rate of 0 in the Remainder Rule calculations, and whether to suppress accumulated returns for units with suppressed direct returns.</p>HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">FAQ</h1>
