<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">

<li>The default setting in new panels: The option “Show profile to others” is disabled, and visibility is activated for the individual standard data. This means that no data are displayed. However, by simply enabling the option “Show profile to others” you can make all data visible and searchable.</li>
</ul>
