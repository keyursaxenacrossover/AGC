ifying domain and server configuration</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">There are some basic prerequisites that must first be met:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>You must be the owner of the domain, i.e. the domain must be registered in your name or in the name of someone acting on your behalf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The owner of the domain must ensure that the domain refers to the panel installation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the configuration of the server on which the panel installation is hosted the domain must be linked to the installation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is necessary to decide if access to panel websites and / or surveys should only be permitted with SSL encryption or if you want to allow both http and https access.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Our support will assist you in performing these steps.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If only <em>one</em> domain is to be linked to your panel installation, no further steps are required.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>2. Mapping the domains if several domains are used</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If you want several domains to refer to your panel, you must subsequently map the domains to the website(s)/language version(s) using the GUI.</p>
<ol class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" start="1">
<li>
<p>To do so, switch to the <strong>Website → Global configuration → Domain mapping</strong> menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add domain</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the first domain in the following format: www.your-domain.com.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the website or language version you wish to map to the domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirm by clicking on <strong>Save mapping</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Repeat these steps for all required domains.</p>

<h2 id="facebook-configuration" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Facebook Configuration</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In panels with Social Insight Connect, the <strong>Facebook configuration</strong> menu contains settings which affect all apps on the installation. For language version-specific options, open the<strong> Edit</strong> dialog and go to the tab <strong>Settings → Facebook</strong>. For details, please see the „Social Insight Connect“ manual.</p>

<h2 id="automatic-checking-of-the-cms-configuration" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Automatic Checking of the CMS Configuration</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The CMS offers a variety of functions and settings. However, users with little or no experience in setting up a panel may find it difficult to understand the relevant relationships and dependencies. These difficulties are overcome by using automated tests.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">They help you identify and correct avoidable errors at an early stage.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>You can either check a complete website or a particular language version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checking of a complete website always includes automatic tests of all those language versions for which you have access rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checking is performed with particular regard to frequent configuration problems that occur when setting up a new panel or a new website. Sometimes, for example, the registration page is not available as it has been activated for logged-in panelists only. Or the active panelists are unable to log in due to incorrectly configured panel statuses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to configuration problems, security aspects are also tested, in particular the susceptibility to XSS (cross site scripting). Many users are not aware of this kind of problem and will consequently ignore them when setting up a panel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Messages referring to critical errors are displayed regardless of whether they pertain to the topic being tested.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="information-6" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Information</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Please note: Many testing algorithms refer to particular page modules and other components of the new CMS. Therefore, testing of migrated and older websites is only possible to a certain extent.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"> </p>
<h3 id="testing-websites-or-language-versions" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Testing Websites or Language Versions</strong></h3>
<ol class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" start="1">
<li>
<p>Choose the desired website or language version. In the “Actions” column, click on the<strong> Test website / Test language</strong> version icon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the areas to be tested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execute the check by clicking on <strong>Perform tests</strong>.</p>
