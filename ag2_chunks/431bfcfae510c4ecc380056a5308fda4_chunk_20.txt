<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863">FAQ</h1>
<h3 id="faq_1">What is the difference between "pinput" and "reg_code"?</h3>
<p>"pinput" (mode of entry) is automatically allocated by the system and describes the type of registration. "reg_code" (way of entry) allows for more detailed description of how panelists entered the panel, especially for entry modes 1, 2, 8, and 16.</p>
<h3 id="faq_2">How is the "md_status" different from the disposition code?</h3>
<p>"md_status" indicates if panelists have participated in any master data survey, while the disposition code is project-specific and indicates how far panelists have completed a specific master data survey they were allocated to.</p>
