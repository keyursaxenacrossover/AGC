<li>Deactivate the display of scale values in a box on the right-hand side of the question. This box typically shows the code, which could cause confusion in this special case.</li>
<li>Be aware that in data analysis, the code for the "0" option will be different (e.g., "101" in our example). Ensure that this is accounted for in any data processing or reporting.</li>

<h3 id="h_01HGKSMPRT7BXGQ0JQJCYXP2VX">Why can't I directly use "0" as a code for the first option in a scale question?</h3>
<p>In EFS, the code "0" is reserved as a system missing value for questions that have been seen but not answered. This limitation applies to most question types, including scale questions.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HGKSMPRT8KFVQ2NQJCYXP2VY">Will this workaround affect my data analysis?</h3>
<p>Yes, it's important to remember that the actual code for the "0" option will be different from what respondents see. Make sure to account for this in your data processing and analysis.</p>
