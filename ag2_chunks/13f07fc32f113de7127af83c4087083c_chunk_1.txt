<li>
<p><strong>Audience (JWT name: aud):</strong> The audience has to match the application that requested the token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Expiration Time (JWT name: nbf, exp)</strong>: Check if the token is not valid from a time perspective. nbf (not-before) will give a hint when the token starts to be valid and exp (expires in) give a hint when the token expires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Issuer (JWT name: iss):</strong> This will be the specific Azure AD B2C App that issued the token. It will therefore start with the B2C domain and subdomain followed by the ID of the App Registration that is connected to Azure B2C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nonce (JWT name: nonce):</strong> The nonce should be set in the authentication request and will be the same value in the authentication response. This should be checked. If possible just use some random value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There should also be an "<strong>acr</strong>" claim that describes the flow the user used to authenticate. It can be read to identify the specific flow.</p>
