<h3 id="header-17">
<strong>Process Control:</strong> <strong>Order Report</strong>
</h3>
<p>On the <strong>Process Control</strong> tab, you are able to specify the report ordering as a follow-up action in the event of a successful process. Up to now, the ordered reports have only been output in PDF format. As of this release, the PPTX file format will be used as a fallback if the report definition is not available as PDF file.</p>
<h3 id="header-18"><strong>Restricted Access for Panel Groups</strong></h3>
<p>You can restrict <em>Guides</em> not only to a portal user role, but also to one of the available panel groups. To do this, use the new setting option (“Restrict guide usage to the following panel groups”) on the <strong>Settings </strong>tab. The guides you created will only be visible on the guides overview page to portal users who belong to the selected panel group. If you restrict the use of guides to a specific portal user role, guides can only be started by those who have been assigned the role, but they will still be displayed to all portal users.</p>

<strong>New </strong><em><strong>Guides</strong></em><strong> View</strong>
</h3>

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Start of the guide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End of the guide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quota of the feedback rater groups</p>
<ul>

</ul>
