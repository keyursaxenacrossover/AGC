<strong>Resetting Two-Factor Authentication in the </strong><em><strong>People</strong></em><strong> Module</strong>
</h3>
<p>As soon as the panelist has fully set up two-factor authentication by scanning the QR code and entering the code from the app, the <strong>Reset 2FA</strong> button is displayed in the panelist administration for this panelist. By clicking this button, you can reset the two-factor authentication for the panelist in question so that they have to scan the QR code again the next time they log in.</p>

<h3 id="header-35"><strong>Behavior in Case of Incorrect Code Entry</strong></h3>
<p>The behavior in case of incorrect code entry is similar to the behavior of incorrect password entry. The settings (such as the number of permitted failed attempts, brute force account lockout time, etc.) that you configure for your website under <strong>Global configuration</strong> &gt; <strong>Login </strong>or<strong> Global configuration</strong> &gt; <strong>Password security</strong> therefore also apply to two-factor authentication.</p>
