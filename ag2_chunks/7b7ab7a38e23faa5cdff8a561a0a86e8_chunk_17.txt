<h4 id="entry-dialog-8">Entry Dialog</h4>
<p>There are some special features in the text field matrix entry dialog:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the “Scale” section the columns are created as explained for the checkbox matrix in the preceding Chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the “Answers” section you can specify the maximum length of the entry for each text field. Default in “Responsive layout” projects: 255 characters. A maximum of 255 characters is permitted.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>

</ul>
<h3 id="accordion-matrix">Accordion matrix</h3>
<p>This question type allows a more accessible display of matrix questions on mobile devices. In addition to making the question more accessible on mobile devices, the nature of the layout of this question type reduces the likelihood of people straight-lining their answers. Along with the settings known for a matrix question type, you will find further settings in the detailed configuration that control the structure of the question in the questionnaire view. The information icon informs you in detail about the various options.</p>
<h3 id="carousel">Carousel</h3>
<p>The carousel question type is one that has been requested by many customers so we are delighted to include this new question type with Responsive Layout 3.1. This question type provides a more intuitive and simple way for a respondent to provide answers to a long list of questions. Rather than presenting a long list of questions, each question is shown individually to the respondent and the survey automatically switches to the next question upon completion of the current question. This question type supports both left-to-right and right-to-left languages.</p>
<h3 id="hotspot-1">Hotspot</h3>
<p>The hotspot question type enables you to place answer options onto particular areas of a selected picture. Before uploading your picture, note that you should start by defining the necessary dimensions and scales.</p>
<p><strong>Elements</strong></p>
<p>This question type has the following content elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question text</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill-in instruction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help text</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scale options 1-n</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Answer options 1-n</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note: When making a matrix question (type 311 or comparable) mandatory (DAC), the check only validates a question of one random dimension. If you wish to have all dimensions answered as a prerequisite please activate DAC on the item level.</p>
