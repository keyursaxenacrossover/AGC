<h2 id="header-55">Enterprise Feedback Suite</h2>
<p>The multilingualism of<em> EFS</em> has been improved. You can create multilingual e-mail templates, for example. New ACL rights have been added so that uploading files to the media library can be restricted to certain users. The <em>Accordion Matrix</em> question type has also been extended.</p>
<h3 id="header-57">Multilingual E-mail Templates</h3>
<p>Previously, e-mail templates could only be created in one language. This obstacle could be circumvented by using if-else conditions. The solution implemented as of this Fall 2019 release will be more practically. You will be able to create e-mail templates in several languages, but also to create SMS texts in several languages. Surveys will also be displayed in the language defined in the panelist account.</p>
