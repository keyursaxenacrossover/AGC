<ul class="ak-ul" data-indent-level="2">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="7671">It will no longer be possible to jump back to the primary survey.</p>
</li>

If you wish to match the data from the primary and secondary surveys without using the tickets, a suitable parameter must be transferred instead of the tickets. For example, you can attach the consecutive number by adding the string ?a=#lfdn# to the destination URL.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-renderer-start-pos="9294">The various EFS products support different project types: anonymous and personalized surveys, panel surveys, master data surveys, and employee surveys. All of these types can be used both as primary surveys and as secondary surveys. If projects with a clearly defined participant pool serve as destinations of a jump, authentication is necessary at the start of the secondary project.</p>

For this, the participants’ authentication codes are used twice: The codes are generated in the secondary project and subsequently imported into a specially created participant variable of the primary project. When jumping from the primary to the secondary project, the codes are transferred as GET parameters to the variable “code”, and the authentication is performed automatically.
