<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">This section explains how to assign user teams to exchange teams and manage their access rights.</p>
<h3 id="rights_configurations" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Rights Configurations</h3>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>Upload right (read): Members can upload and download files, but only change or delete their own files.</li>
<li>Change right (write): Members can upload, download, change, or delete all files of their exchange team.</li>
<li>Read and write: Members have all rights to the exchange team and all upload and change rights but are ignored for the "Send info mail to team" function.</li>

<h3 class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Example Scenario:</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Dividing the persons involved in a project into teams with different rights:</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In a project, not all participants may need the same level of access in EFS Secure Exchange. For example, the HR department at "Real Estate" needs to prepare for an employee survey. HR project managers should have full editing rights for all files, while other staff should only download files and modify/delete their own.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">To manage rights appropriately, create and assign user teams:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<strong>Real Estate project managers</strong>: Unrestricted access.</li>
<li>
<strong>Real Estate staff</strong>: Limited to downloading and editing their own files.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Assign rights to the exchange team "Exchange team Real Estate":</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<strong>Real Estate project managers</strong>: "Write" access.</li>
<li>
<strong>Real Estate staff</strong>: "Read" access</li>
</ul>
