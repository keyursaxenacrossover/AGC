<p>Under the <strong>Basic information</strong> tab, you can provide a title for your newly added guide along with entering a description and uploading an image that will be visible to the portal’s users accessing the guide. The Title, description and picture are displayed in the guide overview area.</p>
<p>The <strong>Additional information</strong> tab allows you to provide more details about the specific guide you are configuring, to help the end-user determine if this is the correct guide (template) that they would like to use. In this area you can provide more detailed descriptions of what the guide will measure and how it will operate. In addition to text descriptions, you can also add photos, videos and links using our new editor, to provide comprehensive details about your new guide.</p>
<p>Under the <strong>Topics</strong> tab, you can associate your new guide with specific topics. These topics must be created first in the <strong>Topics</strong> area of the <strong>Content</strong> section of portals. You select a topic by ticking it and the can choose to display the topics alphabetically in either ascending or descending order.</p>
<p>You use the <strong>Questionnaire</strong> tab to select the specific survey that this guide will send out. You can choose from the list questionnaires that you previously created in our <em>Project</em> module. In order to appear in the list, the project must have been set to <strong>Active</strong>. Only projects of the type <em>Personalized Survey</em> are available for <em>Guides</em>.</p>
<p>The <strong>E-Mail templates</strong> tab is used to select the relevant mail templates that will be used in the guides workflow. You can select templates for the invitation, reminder and result e-mails.</p>
<p>Under the <strong>Settings</strong> tab you can set the participation period for which the guide will remain active for respondents along with the minimum number of participants for the guide. The minimum number of participants setting allows you to maintain confidentiality and only make results available once a minimum number of people have responded to the guide. In this area you also define which portal role is allowed to start the guide and whether a reminder e-mail should be sent, and when. You define whether the e-mails should always be sent to all participants or whether participants who have already completed the survey will not receive any further reminder e-mails. Therefore you deactivate the option “Send reminder mails to all participants” by setting the slide switch to <strong>OFF</strong>. The manager participation setting controls whether the sender of the guide should be allowed to also respond, and a further setting controls whether the initiator of the guide should be able to send to respondents by simply entering in an email address. Lastly there are settings to determine whether a results e-mail should be sent, and where this results e-mail should direct the recipient to. You will see additional settings whereby you can specify a particular page within the portal, and can select a <em>MySight</em> project, a workbook and a view. These settings can direct people to a different dashboard than the one associated with the guide.</p>

<p>Once you have finished configuring your guide, you can make the guide available via your portal by publishing it.</p>
<p><em><u>Guides</u></em><u> in the exterior view</u></p>
<p>After all necessary settings have been made in the CMS area of portals, the new guides module can be accessed in the exterior view. The guide page module will provide a guide overview where all published guides are listed and can be initiated. The information that has been entered under the <strong>Additional information</strong> tab can be accessed by clicking the <strong>More Details</strong> link. You click on <strong>Start guide</strong> to start the guide setup, which is divided into three steps:</p>

<p>In the first <strong>Questions</strong> you will be presented with an overview of the questions that will be asked to the individuals the guide will be sent to. Clicking <strong>Show questions</strong> will present the full list of guide questions. In addition, you will see the topics for this guide (that you had previously created under the Topics tab under the portals configuration). After this overview, which informs you about the key areas of the questionnaire, the second <strong>Invitations</strong> step follows.</p>
