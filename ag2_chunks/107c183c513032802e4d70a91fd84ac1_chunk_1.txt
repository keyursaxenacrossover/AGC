<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If several structure views are used, you will find a drop-down list above the menu where you can switch back and forth between the different structure views. As soon as you change the setting, the desired structure view will be displayed.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Searching for units</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Above the organizational structure, you will find a search function that allows you to browse the structure for a particular unit. This makes it much easier to locate units in complex organizational structures. Depending on the composition of the unit names, you can also use the search function to limit the display to groups of units. Please proceed as follows: Enter the name or part of the name of the desired unit in the field “Organizational unit” and trigger the search process by clicking on <strong>Search</strong>. The results show all units containing the search term, including their path upwards to the main unit (root unit) - i.e., all units one level up. To display all units again, you have to delete the entry in the text field and click on <strong>Search</strong> again.</p>
