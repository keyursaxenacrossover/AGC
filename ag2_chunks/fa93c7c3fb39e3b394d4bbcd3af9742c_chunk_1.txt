 area "Set language selection variable" to select the variable <em>u_isocode</em> and to check the option "Assign language based on ISO code", which set the desired behavior: Survey participants whose preferred language has been stored in the participant administration by means of an ISO code will not only be given the language corresponding to this code, but also the variants of the preferred language corresponding to the conditions, when the survey starts. For example, the manager who takes part in a 360° leadership survey answers the questions in an English version tailored to his needs, while team members receive the phrases tailored to their needs.</p>
<ul>

<p>The prerequisite is, of course, that the corresponding phrases have been entered under "Text elements" in the <strong>Language editor</strong>.</p>

</ul>

<p><em><u>Key phrase extraction trigger</u></em></p>
<p>This trigger can use up to 20 variables to store the returned key phrases, with the last assigned variable storing all remaining key phrases as a comma separated list. The 911 user-defined question type (text variable max 65535 chars) is best suited for use with this trigger.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>When adding the trigger to a page in your survey it is recommended that you use a condition to check if the source text variable contains any text. If your survey uses the back-button or resumption from beginning, we recommended that you allow multiple executions of the trigger </p>
<p><em><u>Sentiment-Trigger</u></em></p>
<p>The sentiment analysis trigger categorizes open text feedback as negative, positive or neutral. The usage of this trigger is similar to that of the <em>Key phrase extraction trigger</em>. The first variable of type <em>short text</em> or <em>text</em> contains the categorization ("negative", "positive" or "neutral") and the optional variable of type <em>float</em> stores the classification points provided by the system. The scale of each category ranges from 0 to 1: 0 represents the most negative and 1 the most positive value of a category.</p>
