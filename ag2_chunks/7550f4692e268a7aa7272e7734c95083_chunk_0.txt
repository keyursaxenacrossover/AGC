<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863">FAQ</h1>

<h3 id="h_01HGKSMPRT7MJJQXHGX2KCGJ11">What is MFA?</h3>
<p>MFA stands for Multi-Factor Authentication. It is a security measure that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to an account or system.</p>

<h3 id="h_01HGKSMPRTCMJMQXHGX2KCGJ12">Why do I need to reset MFA for a user with a new device?</h3>
<p>When a user gets a new device, they need to re-enroll in MFA to ensure that the new device is properly authenticated and can receive MFA prompts or codes.</p>
