 is equipped with the columns “Inbox”, “Ongoing” and “Done”. The three columns help you to document the progress of a ticket. An improvement ticket is created by clicking on the button “Create improvement”. The corresponding ticket is generated in the column “Inbox”. This is furnished with a catchy title by you before the work starts. You sort the tickets horizontally and vertically via drag &amp; drop. Initially, the tickets can be moved back and forth as desired. The improvements are always in the same status for you and every other user.</p>

<h4 id="header-7">The improvement ticket and the detail view</h4>
<p>Each improvement ticket has two icons on the right side of the ticket. They allow a quick orientation, i.e. whether the improvement is already shared and who the person responsible is. Clicking on the<br>ticket or its title gives you access to the detail view. There you share the Improvement with Circles and users who will work on it together, and you also equip the Improvement with a topic in which you can participate by means of the comment function. Any hierarchy, such as an organizational structure, is omitted. Besides you designate one of the users as the person responsible (assignee) by assigning the ticket to her or him.</p>

<p>If you want to be the person responsible (assignee), you use the more option to assign yourself the ticket. Another setting option, regarding improvements, can be found on the profile page. Here you can determine what type of notification, push and/or e-mail you want to receive for what change to an improvement shared with you or for which you are responsible. You can also disable any notification. </p>

<h4 id="header-8">The share function</h4>
<p>To keep the share function simple, a distinction is now made between private and public circle. For new circles to be created, but also for existing ones, you deter- mine now whether they are private or public. Circles that have been published cannot be privatized. The default setting for each circle is: private.</p>
<p><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/20998476027922" alt="de272add-b714-4b6c-8556-77ef10b32281"></p>
<p>They share improvements with all public circles and with the panellists who have access to the portal. Under Shared with you can find out with whom the Improvement is shared, and you can revoke your choice if necessary.</p>

<p>From the number of panellists you share the improvement with, you assign the improvement to one or another, making the person responsible. This choice can also be revoked, although every improvement requires a responsible person.</p>
<h4 id="header-9">Adding categories</h4>
<p>For each improvement you add up to three categories, which you can create in the CMS area of portals on the sub-navigation field Content under <strong>Topics</strong> tab. The colors selected for the categories appear on the Improvement-Ticket. Subcategories that you also create in the CMS area of Portals are not supported currently.</p>
<h4 id="header-10">The comment function</h4>
<p>In the detail view you comment on an improvement. A profile picture, name and surname are displayed. By clicking on name or profile picture you will be forwarded to the profile. The time of the comment is also displayed.</p>

<p>Besides the possibility to enter a text, paste a video link and upload a photo, comments can be answered. If you have activated it, you will be notified by e-mail or push notification when an improvement has been commented on.</p>
<h4 id="header-11">Evaluation of an improvement</h4>
<p>After moving an improvement ticket into the column "Done", you have the possibility to rate it by clicking on the button "Evaluate" visible only in this column. In the detail view you will now find a scale<br>from 1 to 5 on which you can rate the improvement. The rating must be confirmed. Once a user has rated a ticket, it can no longer be removed from the "Done" column.</p>
<h4 id="header-12">Archiving an improvement</h4>
<p>An improvement is archived either automatically after all users have rated it, or manually by clicking on "Archive" under the more option. Tickets that have been archived can only be
