 on the <strong>View</strong> button you can display a dialog that allows you to specify whether the various table columns are to be shown or hidden. You can also change the number of rows per page. After you have confirmed by clicking on <strong>Submit</strong> the table will be expanded accordingly.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">To display the “User ID” you need the <em>export-with_lfdn </em>right. If you would like to obtain this right, please contact our support team.</p>

<h2 id="additional-information" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Additional Information</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The following additional information and functions are available for each data record:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>All participant data. The participants’ names are active links. Clicking on a participant will open the entry form, where you can change the participant’s data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Password and code: depending on whether the login option set for the project is “Password” or “Code”, the corresponding column will contain an activated link that can be copied and passed on (e.g. to a tester who wants to check the questionnaire under real conditions).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “Direct link” column displays an icon that can be used to open and view the questionnaire intended for the respective participant in a pop-up window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have read rights to “show_dispcode”, you can see the disposition code of the participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Question mark</strong> icons indicate values for which there is as yet no corresponding characteristic for “radio button” or “checkbox” type variables. This may occur if you use values in the imported dataset for which you have not yet created any characteristic and for which, at the same time, the function for automatic creation of new characteristics on import is disabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Via the checkbox in the “Actions” column you can select participants to whom you wish to apply the actions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Please note that, by viewing the questionnaire from the perspective of a regular respondent, you will not only change the participant’s disposition code but also capture all your entries as entries made by the participant. It is therefore recommended that you create special tester accounts.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"> </p>
<h2 id="excel-and-csv-export" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Excel- and CSV-Export</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The entire content of the list of participants can be downloaded as one CSV or Excel file. If you wish, for example, to invite project participants to take part in a follow-up project, this feature allows you to easily export all necessary data into this follow-up project.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If you have the read-right <em>show_dispcode</em> necessary for viewing the disposition codes, the export file also contains the disposition codes of the participants.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">To trigger the export, click on either the <strong>Excel export</strong> or <strong>CVS export</strong> buttons.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Please note:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>The Excel export may take some time, depending on the number of data records and variables contained in the list of participants. For large projects, we therefore recommend the CVS export.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an Excel file is opened, depending on the circumstances, a message may be displayed that notifies you that the file is corrupted. This problem is caused by an extension provided by a third-party supplier. Until further notice, please proceed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Save the file locally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, open the saved file, allowing Excel to repair it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, save the file again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Alternatively, if you are using the optionally leasable platform EFS Survey Status, you can offer your customers access to the so-called respondent export. This export contains all those participants who participated in a survey.</p>

<h3 id="faq_1" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">How can I search for participants created within a specific date range?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Use the extended search function and look for the creation date fields in the "Fields with Index" section. You can specify a start and end date to find participants created within that range.</p>
