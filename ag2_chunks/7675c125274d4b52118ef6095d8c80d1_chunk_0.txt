<h1 id="h_01J6W0FVDHGXZR8DTDJ7C0APXC">Overview</h1>
<p>Some users may experience an issue where their system generates unwanted variables with a "_0" suffix in their Surveys/Projects.</p>
<p>These variables can affect specific questions, causing data inconsistencies and hindering the ability to deliver clean data.</p>
<p>The issue may be related to a bug in the system that occasionally generates these "_0" variables, which should not normally occur. To give more context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue tends to happen when list is used for a <strong>loop</strong>.</li>
<li>Brand names are then queried individually in each loop run.</li>
<li>The variables in the loop, e.g. v_100, then receive extensions for each list element, i.e. <strong>v_100_1</strong> for the answers of the first list element, <strong>v_100_2</strong> for the second list element, etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>v_100_0</strong> should not occur based on the above logic</li>
<li>This would rather be a defect, however, we are unable to replicate and have Eng fix it, so we resort to fixing things at DB level.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="h_01J6W0FVDH8WXN2QEKZEN5R119">Solution</h1>
<p>The solution involves deleting the corrupt data set from the MariaDB database. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to MariaDB and search for the loop table of the provided project (for example, project ID 6409 in the bw1774 installation)<br>
<pre>MariaDB [opst_bw1774]&gt; SHOW TABLES LIKE '%6409%';<br>+---------------------------------+<br>| Tables_in_opst_bw1774 (%6409%) |<br>+---------------------------------+<br>| consistency_6409 |<br>| data_cleaning_6409 |<br>| list_elements_6409 |<br>| lists_6409 |<br>| project_languages_6409 |<br>| project_versions_reference_6409 |<br>| question_settings_6409 |<br>| survey_6409 |<br>| survey_6409_1 |<br>| survey_6409_item_score |<br>| survey_6409_loop |<br>| survey_6409_loop_1 |<br>+---------------------------------+<br>12 rows in set (0.005 sec)</pre>
</li>
<li>Search for the corrupt data set by leveraging the <strong>loop</strong> table/s.  <br>
<pre><code>MariaDB [opst_bw1774]&gt; SELECT sl_id,lfdn,list_element_nr FROM survey_6409_loop_1 WHERE list_element_nr = 0;<br>+-------+------+-----------------+<br>| sl_id | lfdn | list_element_nr |<br>+-------+------+-----------------+<br>|  1143 | 1017 |               0 |<br>+-------+------+-----------------+<br>1 row in set (0.000 sec)</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>If you want to further verify the issue, you can proceed to <a href="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20371126622482" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Export</a> the results in XLS format and then search in the resulting XLS for the "<strong>_0</strong>" string to confirm the incorrect variables<br><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21138123797906" width="176" height="169">
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The above query would give us list elements with a 0 index (which are the incorrect ones). Delete the corrupt data set:<br>
<pre><code>MariaDB [opst_bw1774]&gt; DELETE FROM survey_6409_loop_1 WHERE sl_id = 1143 AND lfdn = 1017 AND loop_nr = 0;<br>Query OK, 1 row affected (0.006 sec)</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Once the above is done, you can further verify the fix by <a href="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20371126622482" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exporting</a> the results in XLS format and then searching in the resulting XLS for the "<strong>_0</strong>" string to see the difference from the previous step.<br><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21138147447314" width="250" height="138">
