 different to visitors who have not logged in than to logged-in panelists.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Example: The structure of the “Contact Us” page</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In the standard panel, a normal panel page contains the following elements, each of which is defined in separate templates:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Language selection: This field is only displayed for websites with several language versions.</p>
<ol class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>Navigation: The menus displayed in the navigation depend on whether or not the viewer is logged in.</li>
<li>Messages</li>
<li>Login: Depending on whether or not the viewer is logged in, this area contains different functions, which in turn are defined by two different templates.</li>
<li>Content area: This is filled for each page with the help of content and function modules. Module-specific templates define how the data provided by the modules are output. The illustration shows the content of the “About Us” page.</li>
<li>Subnavigation</li>
</ol>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The main template is responsible for the general structure of the page and for inserting the various individual components into the overall context.</p>

<h1 id="planning-panel-sites" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Planning Panel Sites</strong></h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Setting up a new panel site requires extensive preparation and planning:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>You must determine which pages you need and what the page structure should look like.</li>
<li>Panel sites usually have a specially designed, customized layout.</li>
<li>A panel may have several websites, which in turn may have several language versions. Depending on how greatly the websites and language versions differ, this requires additional planning.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The following contains tips and suggestions for planning panel sites.</p>
<h2 id="planning-page-structure" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Planning Page Structure</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The following considerations should help you develop a plan for the page structure.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Which website(s) and language versions are planned?</strong></p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>Do you plan on creating a single website, or do you wish to set up several websites?</li>
<li>For each website, you must determine whether it should comprise one or several language versions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If you plan on creating several language versions or even several websites each with more than one language version, we recommend going through the following tips individually for each website.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Which pages are required?</strong></p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>Which pages should the new website have? Which pages are necessary for launching the website?</li>
<li>Which pages should visitors have access to and which should be restricted to logged-in panelists only?</li>
<li>Which pages are required for key processes such as recruitment and incentive management? In particular, you should check whether your panel processes require additional function pages beyond those provided in the standard panel. If, for example, you wish to support both the standard admission procedure with registration via the website and targeted recruitment with access codes, you may need a second registration page.</li>
<li>If the website you are editing comprises several language versions, are certain pages only required in one language version? Please note that a website’s page structure is identical for all language versions and does not permit major deviations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Navigation structure</strong></p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>How are panelists to navigate through the website: Via menus? Via links?</li>
<li>Are one or more menus required?</li>
<li>Which pages are to be visible for logged-in/logged-out panelists?</li>
<li>In which order should pages be displayed in the menu?</li>
<li>Should the menu have a second level on which subpages are displayed? Which pages are to appear on the first and which on the second level?</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Content and function of the individual pages</strong></p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>Which content and functions should the new page have? Which page modules can be used to implement the desired functions? Are the existing functions sufficient or does a template need to be modified or newly created to realize a function?</li>
<li>Who do you wish to grant access to a page or a certain page section: all visitors or only logged-in panelists?</li>
<li>If the website you are editing comprises several language versions, should the page be configured differently in the various language versions or contain different content and functions?</li>
</ul>
