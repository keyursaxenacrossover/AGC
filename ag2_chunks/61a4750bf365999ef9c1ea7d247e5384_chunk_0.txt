<h2 id="h_01HGKSMPRT0YJQCQ3QXDJ8XBWM">Understanding Project Archiving</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Survey projects can be archived to reduce database load by compressing the project result data into a zip file, which is then stored in a protected area of the hard disk. This process occurs once a day during low traffic periods, and you will be notified by email after successful archiving. The reactivation function allows you to transfer the project, with or without result data, back to the project list for editing and placement. If you need to delete the result data but want to keep a backup, you can download the zip file and store it locally. As long as the project remains in the EFS installation archive, you can upload the zip file to reactivate the project with its data. Note that the zip file only stores data locally and cannot be used to open or view data outside the EFS installation or to restore a completely deleted project.</p>
