<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In order to create quotas, please proceed as follows:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Create quota</strong> button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the name and the size of the new quota.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirm by clicking on <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The condition editor will open automatically. Define the desired quota condition and click on <strong>Save</strong>. (If you do not define any condition, the quota will not be activated in this step.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After saving, the quota overview will be displayed. There you will find the new quota. It will already be activated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="importing-quotas" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Importing quotas</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Alternatively, <em>EFS</em> allows you to import new quotas. Click on the <strong>Import quotas</strong> button to open the CSV-based import dialog. You can enter one quota per row, using the format label; size; and (alternative) condition. This syntax is easily generated by filling in a 4-column Excel table and saving it in CSV format. Quotas can then easily be imported via copying and pasting the table contents. It does not matter if semicolons or tab stops are used as a separator in the imported file.</p>
<h2 id="configuration" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Configuration</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You are allowed to specify in detail the sequence of the quota process in your project. You will find the configuration options on the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab.</p>
<h3 id="overview-of-the-all-available-setting-options" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Overview of all available setting options</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">By combining these options, you can realize a wide range of processes. By default, all options are activated for new projects and the pre-set allocation mode is “First matching, open quota”. This corresponds to the previous standard mode.</p>

<p>Option 1: If matching external quota is full, reject participants at survey start</p>
</td>
<td style="width: 423.316px;">
<p>This option only applies to external quotas. I.e. usage is only reasonable in personalized surveys, employee surveys, multi-source feedback, panel surveys, and master data surveys with external quota.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If this option is not activated, participants falling within a full external quota can still open the survey. How they will be handled in the course of the survey, i.e. whether they will be screened out by quota, for example, depends on the further configuration and the structure of the questionnaire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this option is activated, the system will continuously check during the project whether any participants who have not yet started the survey fall within a full external quota. If this is the case, these participants will be excluded from the outset, i.e. they are assigned disposition code 41 (“Quota closed”) in the participant administration. Any data accumulated by the participant (during the respective survey) will be deleted in this process and will not be considered in the survey. If these participants try to log in, they will be rejected and assigned disposition code 35 (“rejected at login (quota closed)”). The quota variables of the excluded participants are allocated as follows: “quota” = “-77”, “quota_assignment” = “-66”.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When activating this option, make sure that respondents who are rejected at login will not be confused:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In your invitation, indicate that only the first participants may be able to see the questionnaire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Project properties</strong> → <strong>Survey messages</strong> menu, adapt the text of the message for the rejected participants (“The participant is not accepted for the survey, as the quota is already full (status: filtered out).”).</p>
</li>
</ul>
