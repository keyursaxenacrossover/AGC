<h1 id="h_01J6W53E68E9745H6Q66RJW5X9">Overview</h1>
<p>A customer requested a DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) key for a given domain managed by their client. The DKIM key is to be used on a specific installation for the client, with all messages sent from this installation to be DKIM encrypted. This article provides a solution to this request.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1 id="h_01J6W53E687BTR8HR31YQSP84M">Scope</h1>
<div>The DKIM key is generated by the mail server posting the emails.</div>
<div>For some customers in DXI, mails are created and posted through Hurricane MTA, thus the DKIM should be generated by DXI team and saved in Hurricane, while for other customers, mails are forwarded (relayed) to a customer email server, in that case, DKIM should not be generated by DXI team, but from the customer's mail server (out of scope). </div>
<div> </div>
<div>To confirm if the installation is using our mail server, not a customer email server, apply the following steps:</div>
<ul>
<li>Through Command line in Service Gateway:<br><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21142676614802">
</li>
<li>Or through GUI:
<ul>
<li>Load the instance admin URL using root user</li>
<li>System -&gt; options -&gt; Platform cockpit -&gt; System Configuration</li>
<li>Search for "Mail"</li>
<li>Check the mail server values, these should include a postfix address, not an internal IP address.<img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21142777793426">
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If an internal IP is found (ex: 10.250.xx.xx), we do not add DKIM signing as this always should be done on the mail server which responsible for dispatching the mails...</li>
<li>Additional Info (Just FYI, not needed to complete the request):
<ul>
<li>Usually the Hurricane account used to dispatch emails is appended after the text "postfix". </li>
<li>By default all installations send out via the following accounts
<ul>
<li>EFS-Production (1006)</li>
<li>EFS-Adhoc (1007)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is a naming convention (not a definitive logic), but this should not affect the steps explained below, since the steps apply the new DKIM to all possible sender accounts, even if not used by this installation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional Scoping:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>BofA-US-01</strong> cluster does not use Hurricane MTA at all. It is special and uses AWS mailing service as one of their explicit requirements. The whole process setting up a new sender address in the AWS (including DKIM and SPF) never had been passed to L2. Please forward this to SaaS.<br><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21835357724434">

<p>To set up DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail) for a domain managed by the client, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Generate DKIM Keys:</strong> There is a ready Docker image containing OpenSSL to generate DKIM keys. You need first to install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">docker</a> on your machine if not already installed. After that, steps are based on Linux/WSL terminal.
<ol>
<li>Pull Docker image: <code>docker pull tivian/docker-openssl</code>
</li>
<li> Start Docker image in a Linux/WSL terminal: <br><code>docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/openssl-certs tivian/docker-openssl:latest</code>s</li>
<li>In the docker, Create the folder : <code style="padding: 0px; font-family: SFMono-Regular, Consolas, ' Liberation Mono' , Menlo, Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; color: #2f3941; border-radius: 4px; background: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #d8dcde; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit; white-space: pre-wrap; margin-block: 0px; margin-inline: 2px; padding-block: 0px; padding-inline: 5px;">/openssl-certs/certs/dkimkeys</code> if not already created.</li>
<li>Execute script using the domain provided:
<ul>
<li>Usage:  <code>/usr/local/bin/generate_dkim_keys.sh &lt;domain.tld&gt; tivian</code>
</li>
<li>Example: <code>/usr/local/bin/generate_dkim_keys.sh <strong>ifo.de</strong> tivian</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Copy both Private and public keys:
<ul>
<li>Private key sample (copy starting the --- and till the --- at the end of the key):<br><img src="https://central-supportdesk.zendesk.com/attachments
