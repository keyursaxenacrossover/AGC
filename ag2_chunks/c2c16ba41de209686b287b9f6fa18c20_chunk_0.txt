<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The participant list in EFS offers various search and display functions to help manage large numbers of participants efficiently. This guide will walk you through the available features and how to use them effectively.</p>

<h2 id="simple-search" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Simple Search</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The search functions of the participant list allow you to limit the list to individual participants or participant groups. Then, in the next step, you can apply actions such as e.g. “Invite”, “Generate code”, “Delete” etc. to these subgroups. Usually, the simple search function is displayed.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If there are more than 1000 participants, the search function must be initiated first.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The following rules apply:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Upper- and lowercase spelling will be ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When searching for a specific term, all entries containing the term will be shown in the results list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of one single search criterion, you can also enter a combination of criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The criteria will be joined by an AND, i.e. the results must fulfill all criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can perform several search operations in succession to progressively further restrict a set of results.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">With a large number of results, the first page of the results list may not display all participants found. In such a case, you will find the exact number of currently selected participants in the title bar for the list of participants. You can scroll through the results list using the &gt; (Next page) and &lt; (Previous page) links.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Therefore, note that the group of selected participants may be larger than the number of participants listed on the first results page, in particular when you are using the “All found participants” checkbox.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"> </p>
<h2 id="extended-search" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Extended Search</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The search function of the participant list has been revised so that now large amounts of participants can be searched with a minimum of time. The search is divided into two sections: "Fields with index" and "Fields without index".</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21014721687698" alt="Search 1.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In the section "Fields with Index" you can, for example, search for participants according to the disposition code. A special new feature in this section is the search using the creation date. You can now search for the period in which participants were created. But if you want to search for a specific date/day, the same date must be selected in both fields. A further possibility of the precise and fast participant search is the search for e-mail addresses. To do this, you can use the search for certain elements of an e-mail address in the upper left corner. For example, if you select <em>Ends with</em>, you can search for all e-mail addresses that end on a particular domain. The second search for e-mail addresses is located at the bottom right and allows you to search for several e-mail addresses at the same time by entering these addresses one below the other in the free text field. In the extended search of Personalized Surveys, you can also use the free text field <strong>Code</strong> to search for several codes at the same time.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In the "Fields without index" area, you can search for participant variables that do not have an index in the database. A search in the "Fields without index" area therefore takes much longer than a search in the upper
