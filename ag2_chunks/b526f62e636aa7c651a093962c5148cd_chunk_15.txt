<pre><code class="language-text">Hi TS / 1st,


For this Domain to work properly as an EFS-Alias the customer has to setup DNS first.
There are multiple options available, which are the following in descending order of preference:


Option 1) ALIAS- / ANAME-Record / CNAME Flattening or similar Feature
There is no official name for this, but if the DNS-Provider supports it, it will propably be named like that.

The Record that will have to be configured should look like one of the following:
&lt;Alias-Domain&gt; IN ALIAS &lt;ab1234&gt;.customervoice360.com
&lt;Alias-Domain&gt; IN ANAME &lt;ab1234&gt;.customervoice360.com
&lt;Alias-Domain&gt; IN Flattened-CNAME &lt;ab1234&gt;.customervoice360.com

(if applicable) For the www-Subdomain:
www.&lt;Alias-Domain&gt; IN CNAME &lt;Alias-Domain&gt;


Option 2) NS-Records
With this Tivian takes over all of the DNS-Record Management whithout requiring a DNS-Transfer.

This is a multi-step process which is disruption-free:
1. We need a list of all DNS-Records already on the domain
2. We will then set the up every DNS-Record in that list on our end
3. We configure addtional DNS-Records required by EFS
3. We provide the NS-Record that has to be setup
4. Once the NS-Record is setup the domain-setup is complete


Option 3) Domain-Transfer
The last option would be a Domain-Transfer. We have a Reseller-Contract in place with our DNS-Provider Variomedia.
This way we can set up the domain in a way that the customer remains the domain owner but Tivian deposited as the Technical-Contact.
This way Tivian will manage all DNS-Records, this means any DNS-Change will have to be requested via a Tivian-Support-Ticket.

To get this done disruption-free we need the following:
1. Customer Contact-Info for the Domain-Registration-Preperation at Variomedia
2. A list of all DNS-Records already on the domain
