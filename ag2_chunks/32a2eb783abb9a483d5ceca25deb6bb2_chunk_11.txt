<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">A well maintained FAQ list provides visitors and panelists with answers to frequentlyasked questions. This reduces the amount of support required by you, the panel operator, for answering simple questions.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The EFS Panel’s FAQ management function simplifies creation and maintenance of FAQs. At the same time, CMS gives you considerable room to design the FAQ area:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>FAQ items are created and maintained with the help of a specially developed optimized GUI. This means that a user who is not familiar with the CMS can take over their maintenance without requiring a great deal of training.</li>
<li>You can create an FAQ area for each language version of the website(s).</li>
<li>You can create FAQ items that are restricted to certain panel groups.</li>
<li>A rich text editor is available for designing FAQ items.</li>
<li>You can sort the items into different lists and place these on the panel pages at your discretion. The standard panel comprises an FAQ list the content of which is displayed in the “FAQ” menu. Further lists can be created as required.</li>
<li>You can position the FAQ lists on the panel pages and modify how they are displayed with the help of the “FAQ list” module. Further changes to display and layout can be made using the “func_faq” template.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">This Chapter will show you how to maintain the content of the FAQ. The “FAQ list” function module is presented in Chapter "  ".</p>
<h3 id="managing-faqs" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Managing FAQs</strong></h3>
