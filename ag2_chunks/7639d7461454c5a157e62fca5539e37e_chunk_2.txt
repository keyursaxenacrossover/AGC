<h3 id="header-16">Management of Genders</h3>
<p>The People module now allows you to create and use more than the previously two genders for your panelists. New genders can be created and be managed via your own list in the <strong>Panel configuration</strong>. A handy panelist counter shows the usage of genders and blocks the deletion if panelists are assigned to a gender.</p>
