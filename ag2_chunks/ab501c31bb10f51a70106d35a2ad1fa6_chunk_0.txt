<p>All areas (e.g. admin area, surveys, portals, or panel websites) admin users or participants access in EFS, are always secured via HTTPS (TLS/SSL). Tivian’s infrastructure enforces HTTPS: So even if you call a URL using HTTP, the webserver will always answer this call with HTTPS.</p>

<h3 id="h_01HGKSMPRT3MXGR1ZKWQ6XKPGP">Is the use of EFS secure?</h3>
<p>Yes, the use of EFS is secure. Tivian implements HTTPS (TLS/SSL) encryption for all areas of the platform, including admin areas, surveys, portals, and panel websites.
