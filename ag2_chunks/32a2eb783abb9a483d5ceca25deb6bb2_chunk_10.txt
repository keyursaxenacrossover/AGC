<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If you want to view messages of another language version that you’re authorized to access in a given installation with several websites and/or language versions, simply change the settings in the upper section of the dialog. You can use the View function to change the number of table columns displayed as well as the number of rows per page.</p>

<li>If you want to remove several messages at once, tick the respective checkboxes of these messages in the “Delete” column. Depending on the situation, you may also use the checkboxes “Mark all entries on this page” and “Mark all entries found” below the table. After that, confirm by clicking on <strong>Delete</strong>.

<h2 id="creating-a-new-message" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Creating a New Message</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">A new message will only be displayed if you also define a rule for invoking it. Currently, this is only possible for the registration form. Rules on invoking the other messages must be configured by our support. Therefore, creating messages is currently not advisable unless the messages concern registration or have been erroneously deleted.</p>

<ol class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>Clicking on the <strong>Create message</strong> button will open the entry form for creating a new message assigned to the current language version.</li>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The EFS Panel’s FAQ management function simplifies creation and maintenance of FAQs. At the same time, CMS gives you considerable room to design the FAQ area:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>FAQ items are created and maintained with the help of a specially developed optimized GUI. This means that a user who is not familiar with the CMS can take over their maintenance without requiring a great deal of training.</li>
<li>You can create an FAQ area for each language version of the website(s).</li>
<li>You can create FAQ items that are restricted to certain panel groups.</li>
<li>A rich text editor is available for designing FAQ items.</li>
<li>You can sort the items into different lists and place these on the panel pages at your discretion. The standard panel comprises an FAQ list the content of which is displayed in the “FAQ” menu. Further lists can be created as required.</li>
<li>You can position the FAQ lists on the panel pages and modify how they are displayed with the help of the “FAQ
