You allow the addition of participants with the slide switch "Adding participants allowed?". "Minimum number of participants" and "Maximum number of participants" are used to control how many participants can be added.</p>

<p>In the Guide setup of the<em> Portal's</em> exterior view, the<strong> Invitations</strong> step is used to present the invitations to the users. A special feature that must be pointed out in this context is the company-managed groups created dynamically using a filter, since you allow users to automatically offer their own manager and their own team.</p>
<p>This requires a special filter setting and a special composition of the company-managed group.</p>
