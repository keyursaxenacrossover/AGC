The consecutive number of the respondents (“lfdn”) is automatically transferred to the secondary project via “tic”. You should be able to locate the “lfdn” of a data record in the primary project in the column labeled “external_lfdn” of the secondary project’s matching data record.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" data-renderer-start-pos="5660">During the external survey start information on the participants is transferred from one survey to the other by adding it to the URL as a GET parameter. Basically, this is done in one of the following ways:</p>

<p data-renderer-start-pos="6697">If the jump connects two <em data-renderer-mark="true">EFS </em>projects, the tickets ensure that you can match the data records.

<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="6967">If you are using external software and wish to match the data records later, Instead, you have to transfer “tic”, “lfdn” or another value that might serve to identify the participants via GET parameter.</p>

<p data-renderer-start-pos="7416">You can decide for yourself whether you want to use “tic” and “return_tic” at all. If no ticket is added, only the URL (optionally with attached parameters) will be transferred when jumping to the secondary survey. This has the following consequences:</p>
<ul class="ak-ul" data-indent-level="2">
<li>

If you wish to match the data from the primary and secondary surveys without using the tickets, a suitable parameter must be transferred instead of the tickets. For example, you can attach the consecutive number by adding the string ?a=#lfdn# to the destination URL.</p>
