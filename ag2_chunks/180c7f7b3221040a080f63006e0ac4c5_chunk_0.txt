<h1 id="h_01J6CNR5R96N4FDMW9X23M4ZR2">Overview</h1>
<p>You will receive instance deletion/deprovisioning requests from the Sales team for customers that are cancelling/churning. This article provides a high-level overview of the steps to be taken in order to accomplish this, along with a checklist to follow in order to make sure that all loose ends are tied up.</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><strong>Note: If the request is related to shared instances like EFS-Survey.com or Unipark, do not follow the below steps. We just set the expiration date on the individual organization in that case.</strong></div>
<h1 id="header-1">Process</h1>
<p>From a high-level standpoint, the procedure will consist of:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the requestor is a customer, please reach out to Sales for approval. If the requestor is internal, please proceed with step 2.</li>
<li>Send an SC to the customer contact, if it is not in the ticket, please reach out to renewals/Sales team and notify aditi.garg@trilogy.com about the same. If it is Ipsos, please reach out to <a href="mailto:nicole.romens@ipsos.com">nicole.romens@ipsos.com</a>.<br><span style="color: #ebebeb; font-family: Inter, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; background-color: #2b2c2f; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">Subject: Important Notice: Scheduled Deletion of Your Instance</span><br>Dear Customer,<br>This is to inform you that your cancellation request for &lt;this instance&gt; has been processed, and it is scheduled to be deleted in the next 48 hours.

<h2 id="header-3">Steps to Follow</h2>
<ol>
<li>First of all, we need to make sure that the support ticket contains the <strong>minimum</strong> information below:
<ul>
<li>Name of installation: [ab1234].customervoice360.com (can be found in Globis)</li>
<li>Time for deletion: immediately or <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>at a specific date</strong></span>
<ul>
<li>If the above information is missing, you need to <strong>confirm it with the ticket requester</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Similar to <a href="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20714568035218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Provisioning new DXI installations (WIP)</a>, we have a template that can be used in order to fulfill this task.
<ol>
<li>The template is attached to this article, and it also contains instructions for how to fulfill each action</li>
<li>Steps in the template that have been done, are marked with an <strong>x</strong>, and steps where nothing had to be done except checking, get an <strong>o</strong>.</li>
<li>Replace all <code>{{PLACEHOLDER}}</code> entries with their relevant real counterparts, and this will result in having all the information outlined and just ready to copy/paste.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Once you take any actions, save the changes made to the txt file (and rename it to <strong>EFS_Deletion_Checklist_ticketID.txt</strong>); this is very important, since this will likely go through the hands of multiple agents through the entire lifecycle of the ticket</li>
<li>In the end, inform the requester that the installation has been purged (a template for this is also found in the TXT file)</li>
</ol>
