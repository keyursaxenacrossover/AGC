<p>Manual creation is useful, for example, if you want to subsequently add individual persons.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Depending on whether you work in the centralized user management or a particular unit, the process may be slightly different. If you work in centralized user management, you have to explicitly allocate the users to one or several units, whereas the allocation is done automatically in unit-specific user management. The allocations can also be imported.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Creating users manually in the centralized user management</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Creating user accounts from the centralized user management - whether manually or by import - requires two steps:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>the actual creation of the accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the allocation to units. (Depending on how the project is organized, the allocation may be done by import, at a later date, or delegated to users.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Creating user accounts manually</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Please proceed as follows:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Open the <strong>Projects</strong> → {Selected project} → <strong>Org Processor</strong> → <strong>Org Processor users</strong> menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the search function to check whether there is already a user account for the respective person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this is not the case, click on the <strong>Add User</strong> button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the data. The following rules apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First name, last name, and e-mail address are mandatory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of the other fields is optional.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the project management has activated the semi-automatic delivery of login details, you will also find a checkbox “Send account data automatically when saving”. If you tick this checkbox, the new user will automatically receive an e-mail with his login details.</p>

<li>
<p>Confirm by clicking on <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>You can perform this allocation on the <strong>Organizational Units</strong> tab. Locate the desired unit(s) and tick the respective “Action” checkbox(es). Select the respective role from the drop-down list that you want the user to have in this unit, and confirm by clicking on <strong>Execute</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If another user already has the desired unit allocation, <em>EFS</em> allows you to adopt this for new users. For users that have not been allocated to any unit yet, the corresponding function “Copy role of following account” can also be found on the <strong>Organizational Units</strong> tab. With the <strong>binocular</strong> icon, you can select the user account with the desired unit and role allocation. Please note: The purpose of this function is to copy the unit allocations listed on the <strong>Organizational Units</strong> tab. Allocations of users to logistics sites or reshipment points cannot be adopted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also perform this allocation by import for all users of the entire project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, you can also leave it to already existing users of the higher levels to allocate additional users within their areas of responsibility.</p>
