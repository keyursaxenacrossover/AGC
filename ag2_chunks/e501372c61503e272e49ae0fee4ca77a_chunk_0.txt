<h1 id="panelist-blogs" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Panelist Blogs</h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can allow the members of your panel community to keep their blogs. The functional scope in brief:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>The panelists can keep their blogs. Depending on the goals of your research, you can realize diary-like, private blogs, which can be accessed only by their authors and the panel moderators, or public blogs which other panelists can comment on.</li>
<li>It only takes you a few clicks to present a sample of the best blogs on an overview page on the website.</li>
<li>From EFS 10.3, it is possible to create a teaser that automatically displays the most recent, best-rated, or most frequently rated blog content.</li>
<li>
<p>The blogs are created automatically when the panelists click on a corresponding link. You can create additional blogs for moderators and testers manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each blog is allocated to a particular blog section. You can set up and manage different blog sections for each language version of your website. The panelists may have one blog in each section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As in the forums, you can decide whether all visitors, only logged-in panelists, or only members of a specific panel group should have access to the blogs within a particular section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various moderation features are available to moderators, some of which may also be used by the blogging panelist. For example, you can create private, diary-like blogs. Or you can enable the comment function and even allow anonymous comments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A post consists of a name, date, subject header, and body text. The names are links to the panelists’ profiles. This content structure can be edited via the template.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can integrate a WYSIWYG editor, thus encouraging the panelists to create appealing posts. Such an editor has been integrated into the sample pages of the standard panel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally, you may integrate a rich text editor with which the panelists can create appealing posts. Such an editor has already been integrated into the sample pages of the standard panel. Furthermore, the panelists may embed multimedia content via special tags.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally, you can activate file upload and allow panelists to illustrate their posts with images. Just a few clicks are needed to set up appealing image galleries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a panelist logs in, all posts added since the last login will be marked as new. The highlighting of new posts with a special icon or label is defined in the template.</p>
<p> </p>
