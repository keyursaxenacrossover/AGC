<p>You, or optionally the blog authors, can allow the panelists to post anonymously. If a panelist ticks the corresponding checkbox before posting, his profile will not be linked - even if he has explicitly activated the display of his profile data. To prevent abuse, however, the identity of the poster will be logged so that you as a moderator can check it in the admin area.</p>
