<p><strong>Why is a mirror installation necessary?</strong></p>
<p>A mirror installation allows for thorough testing without affecting the live production environment, ensuring that any issues can be identified and resolved before going live.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if issues are found during the test phase?</strong></p>
<p>Any issues identified during the test phase should be resolved before proceeding to the production phase to ensure a smooth rollout.</p>
<p><strong>Why are activation emails sent out last?</strong></p>
<p>Activation emails are sent out after the production environment is fully configured and tested to ensure that users can access the system immediately upon receiving the email.</p> to Okta without sending out a mail</p>
