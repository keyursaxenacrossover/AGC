<h2 id="wcag_overview">WCAG Overview</h2>
<p>WCAG stands for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These guidelines are designed to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="development_approach">Development Approach</h2>
<p>Responsive Layout Version 3.* and Portals have been developed following best practices in accessibility and Web standards compliance. The development team followed WCAG 2.0 AA recommendations whenever possible during the creation of Responsive Layout 3.*.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="testing_and_limitations">Testing and Limitations</h2>
<p>The usability of Responsive Layout 3.* was tested in most common screen readers such as Jaws, NVDA, and MacOS VoiceOver. However, due to the wide range of available screen readers, their frequent updates, different interpretations of standards, and various methods for browsing web pages, error-free operation cannot be guaranteed in all available readers and their versions.</p>
<p><strong>The layout was not externally tested and certified through an independent 3rd party, therefore we are unable to guarantee that our standard layout is 100% fulfilling all WCAG 2.0 AA requirements. Customers requiring a layout fulfilling a specific WCAG level should contact our professional services team.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="support_and_improvements">Support and Future Improvements</h2>
<p>The development team is committed to providing fixes for specific bugs or issues as soon as possible when made aware. If you can reproduce a specific bug or issue with a screen reader, please reach out to our support team.</p>
<p>The mid-/long-term roadmap includes further accessibility improvements to survey layouts and additional accessible question types. These improvements aim to enhance standards compliance, support more recent WCAG recommendations, and improve usability for screen reader users.</p>
