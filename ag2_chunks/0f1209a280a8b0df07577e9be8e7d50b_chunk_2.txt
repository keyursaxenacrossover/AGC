<h1 id="h_01J679RW2J93J5WE1Y5BG3YD7P">Okta Groups</h1>
<p>Groups are a way in Okta to manage people and create scoped sets of rules.</p>
<p>In our case groups are not used for authorization but to create a scope for specific use cases. As we are managing multiple tenants in one Okta tenant this is also a tool to separate tenants.</p>
<p>Okta Authorization Server</p>
<p>An Authorization Server is an entity that is used to gather tokens. It defined the security boundary from one tenant to another. The tokens from one Authorization Server could not be used in the scope of another authorization server.</p>
<p>An Authorization Server requires some configuration.</p>

<p>Claims</p>
</td>

<p>Claims are specific values of a user. They can be tied to a scope and also to a specific token type.</p>
<p>In our case the first name and the last name have to be present in the ID Tokens when requesting the profile scope.</p>

<p>Factor enrollment is a process in Okta that takes care of collecting Multi Factor information from users accessing applications. Factor enrollment defines which users have to provide Multi Factor data.</p>
<p><strong>Keep in mind that the factor enrollment does not mean that MFA is active. MFA will be activated using a Sign-On Policy see: <a href="#h_01J679R075MB44V7NHKF8FZNJN">Sign-On Policy</a>.</strong></p>
