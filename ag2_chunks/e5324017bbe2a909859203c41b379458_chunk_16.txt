 the officially supported Google Authenticator.</p>

<p data-renderer-start-pos="1166">The default behavior is that a user has to provide the second factor each time he/she logs in. This includes an option that the second factor of a user is remembered by Okta and does not need to be provided again for a fixed time. More configuration could be provided.</p>

<p data-renderer-start-pos="1519">This can be configured in our Identity Provider.

<p data-renderer-start-pos="1714">No, all MFA usage is included in the fee paid for Tivian Access as per the 2020 rollout package.</p>
<h4 id="How-can-a-user-reset-MFA-?" data-renderer-start-pos="1812"><strong data-renderer-mark="true">How can a user reset MFA ?</strong></h4>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="1840">In case you lost your mobile phone and are not able to receive SMS or did loose the configured authenticator app, only an administrator can reset it for you in Okta.</p>

<h4 id="How-will-MFA-be-configured-in-case-the-customer’s-Identity-Provider-already-supports-MFA?" data-renderer-start-pos="2069"><strong data-renderer-mark="true">How will MFA be configured in case the customer’s Identity Provider already supports MFA?</strong></h4>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="2160">In case the customer’s Identity Provider already offers MFA and it is already in use, there is no need to add additional MFA capabilities from our Identity Provider (Okta).</p>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="2334">If MFA is configured at the customer’s Identity Provider and Okta the customer’s users have to provide MFA two times. If that is the desired behavior it could be configured - but user experience might be questionable.</p>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="2553">If a customer is already using MFA we should not force our MFA solution replacing the customer’s solution. It is best if the customer is already using MFA and does not need to use our Okta MFA services.</p>

<h2 id="h_01J6EY4CEC4PATHWTDK9KJERAX">Troubleshooting: As it happens</h2>
<h4 id="header-17"><strong>It seems the current Okta login page does not work corretly - how can I login to fix that issue?</strong></h4>
<p>This should never happen on any production environment.</p>
<p>There is a bypass login that might help with the current issue - it can be found when adding “/login/default” to the base URL of the current Okta account (e.g. “<a href="https://okta.testback.com/login/default">https://okta.testback.com/login/default</a>“)</p>
