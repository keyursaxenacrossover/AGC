<h2 id="renting-panelists-out-to-externally-conducted-surveys" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Renting Panelists out to Externally Conducted Surveys</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">This section describes how panelists can participate in a survey that does not take place within the panel but in another EFS Panel installation or, as the case may be, in another software environment. The challenge here is to provide incentives to the panelists promptly.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Determine firstly whether the software used to survey your panelists can save transferred parameters and insert them back into the link when returned to the panel site (in technospeak: Individual parameters for each panelist are transferred via GET and must be dynamically inserted into the return-to-panel-site link).</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Should the software used on the actual survey platform be capable of the above, then it is recommended that you implement this using the external survey start feature. The survey is executed in three parts: An introductory page is located on your panel installation. After clicking on the Continue button you are sent to the external software, and at the end you are sent back to the panel installation. The transfer of parameters during transfer, transfer back and in the export data record makes it possible to perform matching between the two surveys. The dedicated manual “External Survey Start” explains in detail how to configure this.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Anonymous export of the panelist sample</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">An alternative is the anonymous export of the panelist sample:</p>
<ol class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>Form a group of the panelists that will be surveyed.</li>
<li>Using the selective master data export, export the information that you would like to make available to the external cooperation partner, containing at least the pseudonym (the “pseudonym” variable).</li>
<li>The external cooperation partner enters the pseudonym into the participant administration of their project. You invite the panelists from your system via email, indicating in the e-mail a URL to the survey of the co-operation partner. (Please note that you must enter this manually, you cannot use the usual mail wildcards from EFS Panel.) Indicate in the e-mail that the incentive for this project can only be given out after a certain delay at the end of the project.</li>
<li>At the end of the survey, you will need a list of the people who successfully completed the survey from the external co-operation partner. The list must contain the pseudonym.</li>
<li>Extract the mentioned pseudonyms into a one-column CSV file. Import the pseudonym file as a new group (see Chapter 8.3, p. 156). The group created this way can be given incentives using the appropriate functions of group administration.</li>
