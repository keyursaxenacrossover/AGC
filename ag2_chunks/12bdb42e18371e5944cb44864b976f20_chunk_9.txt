 Submit Button</h4>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can use this function to hide the submit button temporarily or always. Thus only the questions and answers will be output on the questionnaire page, the <strong>continue </strong>button will appear not at all or only after a time. You may also deactivate the <strong>submit </strong>button for a specific amount of time.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can choose from the following options:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Always show Submit button: This is the default setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always hide Submit button: The Submit button will not appear on this page. Please remember when using this setting to incorporate another form element that can be used to trigger the Submit process or activate a function for automatic sending. The combination of hidden Submit button and automatic page down is useful, for example, with cover tests, in which media is only shown briefly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show after x seconds: You can choose periods from between one second and two minutes. This setting is advisable if you wish to make sure that the respondents look closely at a picture or text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select <strong>Disable instead of hiding submit button </strong>in combination with an option from the <strong>Hide submit button </strong>drop-down menu, e. g. <strong>Show after 11 seconds. </strong>The submit button will only be visible after a countdown of 11 seconds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The function assumes that JavaScript is enabled in the respondent’s browser.</p>

<h4 id="inserting-a-cancel-button" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Inserting a Cancel Button</h4>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">This option allows you to insert an additional image on the respective page. If the participant clicks on this image, the survey window will be closed. Upload the appropriate image via the media library.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Please note: You can only use this function if you have activated graphical form elements.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">This option does not work with all browsers for the following reason: JavaScript has a security setting that prevents windows from being closed via JavaScript if they were not opened with JavaScript. EFS Survey is not opened using JavaScript, therefore it is also not possible to close it using JavaScript. Many browsers, such as Internet Explorer do not adhere to this security setting entirely, instead, they display a confirmation window that queries the surfer as to whether he would really like to close the window: With these browsers the Cancel button functions as expected - the respondent can close it after confirming the window. With browsers that follow the security settings closely, such as Mozilla Firefox, the Cancel button will not work.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can test this function in productive mode, not in the preview: The preview is opened via JavaScript, therefore the browser-specific behavior described cannot be observed.</p>

<h4 id="defining-page-specific-javascript-actions" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Defining Page-Specific JavaScript Actions</h4>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You have the option of inserting JavaScript code which will be executed once the page is sent. For this feature, it is required that JavaScript is enabled in the respondent’s browser.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Example: alert(‘Please read the question text carefully’);</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In this case, for example, a small message window with the corresponding text will be output once the page has been sent.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Please Note: Only single quotation marks (') are permitted. If double quotation marks are used, the feature won't work.</p>

<h4 id="customizing-a-specific-page-with-javascript-or-css" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Customizing a Specific Page with JavaScript or CSS</h4>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Sometimes it is necessary to create a different design for a particular questionnaire page or to implement a page-specific JavaScript function. This is frequently realized using a specific template or an “if” construct in the main template. But you can also upload JavaScript and CSS in a dedicated file and integrate it into the header or footer section of the desired page.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">To do so, please proceed as follows:</p>
<ol class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify" start="1">
<li>
<p>Upload the desired files via <strong>Pro editor</strong> → <strong>Upload</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the <strong>Page Properties </strong>menu for the desired questionnaire page. The file lists in the fields “Header section” and “Footer section” contain all files with the extensions .js and .css which were uploaded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the desired files and <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
