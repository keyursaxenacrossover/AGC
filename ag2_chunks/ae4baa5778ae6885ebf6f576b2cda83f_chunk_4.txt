 the selection dropdown. From now on, also private groups are listed. When sharing with a private group, that group will be published and will no longer be private. This publishing of a private group needs to be confirmed through a dialog and cannot be undone.</p>
<p><u>Maximum number of actions</u></p>
<p>By default, the maximum number of actions that can be created is 200 per installation. If this value is exceeded, the tickets created after the 200th action ticket are hidden until the value fall below the maximum value again due to the deletion or archiving of tickets. The hidden tickets are still saved and can be archived.</p>
<p>If you wish to increase this value, please contact support.</p>
<p><u>Actions presented in the module </u><em><u>Activity stream</u></em></p>
<p>The activities in the <em>Action Board</em> are now displayed in the page module <em>Activity stream</em>, so that you always have a good overview of what is happening on the <em>Action Board</em>. The stream will show changes to the tickets that are visible to you.</p>

<p><em><u>Portal invitation</u></em></p>
<p>In the <em>Portal Invitation</em> page module configuration, it is now possible to assign invited participants to any or all of the following roles: moderator, survey manager or translation manager. If no role is selected the user is assigned the role <strong>Participant</strong>. You also have the option of selecting additional master data variables. By default, the variables e-mail, first name and last name are offered, however six more are additionally configurable. For each variable you can decide whether the field is required and whether it should be validated.</p>
<p>These additional fields are presented to the portal users when they are inviting a new user to the portal. In the wizard, you can also select one of the panel-groups to which these new users are added. If you want to invite several users at the same time, use the CSV upload: CSV files can be imported by drag &amp; drop. To do this, download an import template and follow the instructions provided in the template.</p>

<p><u>Renaming and redesigning of </u><em><u>Circles</u></em></p>
<p>Our <em>Circles</em> feature, released in Summer 2017, allowed you to create and manage your own contact lists from the participants of a portal. This feature has been renamed to <em>Groups (Portals)</em> and also redesigned. The exterior view of the <em>Groups</em> module displays the created groups in a clear overview. The groups can be created, deleted and privatized there.</p>

<p>The module is still accessible from our <em>People</em> module, under the Contracts sub-menu. These groups have been updated so that they no longer need to be owned by the person who created the group. It is now possible to change ownership by selecting one of the other group participants as future owner by accessing the <em>group list</em> view and then changing the group owner. The owner can edit or delete the group.</p>

<h3 id="header-8">Multi language portals and a new role: Translation Manager</h3>
<p>A new development that will delight many of our global customers is the additional of multi-language support for our portals. In the past if you wished to have a portal available in multiple languages, you would need to create a new portal for each of the languages you wished to make available to your users. This created a significant administration overhead and did not offer the best experience to your portal users. It is now possible to have one single portal and make it available in multiple languages.</p>
<p>To add a new language to an existing or new portal you need to go to the subnavigation <strong>Settings</strong>, and then go to the <strong>Languages</strong> section.</p>
