<p>The IAM project does not tackle authorization or access rights. The focus of the IAM module is authentication. (also see <ac:link ac:card-appearance="inline"><ri:page ri:content-title="Business Decisions" ri:version-at-save="13"></ri:page><ac:link-body>Business Decisions</ac:link-body></ac:link> )</p><p></p><p>The specific authorization rules of EFS and Portals still apply. As they are tightly coupled to the business cases of the applications they can currently not be handled by a mire generic IdP like Okta and also not by a clientâ€™s Identity Provider.</p><p></p><p>Therefore every user that is able to login at Okta is a valid authenticated user.

A user that is not known by an application should be rejected.</p>
