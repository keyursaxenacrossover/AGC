<h4 id="h_01J964YG3E46DZZ0A1DTD4FPPZ">Step 1: Review the Database for Panelist Registration Records</h4>
<p>To analyze the panelist records and identify discrepancies, execute the following SQL query to retrieve relevant data from the panelist registration tables.</p>
<p>Just replace theÂ  <code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-sql">pa.reg_code</code> in the query below with the correct values for the Way of Entry having the issue.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">SELECT
	pa.uid,
	pa.pseudonym,
	p.u_email,
	p.u_firstname,
	p.u_name,
	pa.penter_date,
	pa.reg_code,
	pe.title,
	pav.remote_addr AS ip_on_registration,
	prk.rkey	,
	prk.active,
	prk.used
FROM
	panel_att AS pa
	LEFT JOIN panel_recruitment_keys AS prk ON ( prk.rid = pa.reg_code AND prk.uid = pa.uid
	)
	LEFT JOIN panel_entry AS pe ON (pa.reg_code = pe.reg_code)
	LEFT JOIN panelists AS p ON (pa.uid = p.uid)
	LEFT JOIN panel_att_var AS pav ON (pa.uid = pav.uid)
WHERE
	pa.reg_code IN (136, 139)
	AND prk.rid IS NULL
ORDER BY pa.penter_date ASC;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>This query helps to identify the panelists registered under the given campaigns (PB_JUN_24, PB_JUL_24) without corresponding registration keys.<br><img src="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/21739279832722">
</li>
<li>
<code>panel_entry</code>: Stores information about the "ways of entry" (reg_code and title).</li>
<li>
<code>panel_recruitment_keys</code>: Contains information on the actual recruitment keys (<code>rkey</code>) and their statuses (<code>active</code>, <code>used</code>).</li>
<li>The unique PRI key <code>reg_code</code> from the table <code>panel_entry</code> and the MUL key <code>rid</code> in the table <code>panel_recruitment_keys</code> can be used to join both tables (each way of entry can have N unique LMI keys therefore you have this PRI to MUL relation between those tables)</li>
<li>
<strong>Registration IP Address</strong>: Query identifies the IP address the panelist had while registring (Column <code>remote_addr</code> from table <code>panel_att_var</code> which can be joined by the <code>uid</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="h_01J964YG3EQC5BPJVHYZPYYRWY">Step 2: Analyze Web Server Logs with Grafana Loki</h4>
<p>It is possible to use AWS Cloudwatch logs to get the actual codes used for each panelist, however CW logs are maintained for 1 month only. If the registration is older than 1 month, we would need to check Grafana logs.</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/21741183591314-Accessing-and-Querying-Grafana-Logs-A-Comprehensive-Guide"><strong>Grafana Loki</strong> </a>to investigate web server logs by looking for requests from the IP addresses found in Step 1:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Grafana Loki</strong> and restrict to the namespace of the installation (e.g., <code>tr9043</code>).</li>
<li>Run the query for the relevant job (<code>tr9043/nginx</code>) and search for access logs around the registration dates (from <code>pa.penter_date</code>).</li>
</ol>
