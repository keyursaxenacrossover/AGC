<h3 id="project-types" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Project Types</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In EFS, feedback collection is organized into individual projects. The features and processes required in these projects depend strongly on the data collection method and the target group chosen. Therefore, the various <em>EFS</em> solutions support quite different project types.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Anonymous Surveys (AN)</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><em>Anonymous surveys</em> are accessible for all who know the respective survey Internet address. This is usually conducted by means of advertising efforts such as banners or hyperlinks on existing websites.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Personalized Surveys (PE)</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><em>Personalized surveys</em> are only accessible to persons included in the survey sample. In a personalized survey, you can precisely define who you wish to include as participants in your online survey. You may either enter participants manually or import the list of participants into<em> EFS</em> in an Excel sheet (CSV file). There are various options for how to restrict access to the survey. For example, using a password sent to the participants via e-mail, or via a personalized link or definable IP addresses. The respective passwords for participants can be either generated within<em> the EFS Survey</em> or imported into the system.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Employee Surveys (ES)</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The project-type Employee survey is used only on <em>EFS Employee</em> installations. It satisfies particularly strict data protection guidelines and allows access to the optionally available additional tool Org Processor.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Multi-Source Feedbacks (MSF)</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><em>Multi-source feedbacks</em> allow us to realize complex multi-rater feedback processes, e.g. 360° leadership surveys.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Panel Surveys (PA)</strong></p>
