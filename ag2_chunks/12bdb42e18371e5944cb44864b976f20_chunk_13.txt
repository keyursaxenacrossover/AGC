 filtering via content from the participant administration. Produces all texts that contain the entered text element, for example when filtering for “cd” “abcde” will also be filtered out. Filtering is case sensitive, blank spaces will be regarded as an incorrect entry. Umlauts can be used.</p>

<p>Firstly, you can use this condition to check whether an entry contains one of several specified elements. Example: Entering “22” would fulfill the condition “contains any = 11,<strong>22</strong>,33”, whereas entering “123” or “122” would not. Secondly, you can use this condition to identify a specific element in an entry that consists of multiple elements, such as a phone number. Example: Entering “0229-<strong>1234</strong>” would fulfill the condition “contains any = 1234”, whereas entering “0229-12345” would not. Acceptable separators are comma, apostrophe, “- “ and “|”.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In many questionnaires, it is considered polite to have a final open-ended question at the end of the questionnaire and ask the respondent if they have anything else to say. Especially if you design a survey in the form of a conversation, it is to be expected that not all the thoughts the respondent has developed while answering the questionnaire will be revealed with the help of closed-ended questions. In order to give the respondent the opportunity to round off the conversation from their point of view, they are allowed to enter information. The survey manager has this sent to himself directly in order to have the option of reacting directly to events in the field.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Below, a mail trigger for a personalized survey is created to trigger the dispatch of such a participant's comment to the survey manager.</p>
