<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Workflow buttons</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The workflow buttons are an important feature when editing tasks. Depending on the status of a task, you can perform different workflow actions without having to switch to edit mode. Depending on the status, you can assign tasks to yourself or to another person, escalate, close or reopen tasks as well as invite participants to follow-up surveys. Workflows automatically move status from Not started to Started when triggered.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Assigning tasks to yourself</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">With this workflow, you can assign tasks to yourself as the current user. To assign a task to yourself, click on the workflow button <strong>Assign to me</strong>. The task is automatically assigned to yourself.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Assigning tasks to users</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">With this workflow, you can assign tasks to users of your own unit only or to users of your own unit and all levels down. However, this doesn’t mean, that you can assign a task to all persons of subordinate levels at the same time. You can merely choose one person of all subordinate levels. If you want to rapidly assign several persons, you have the option of copying a task.
