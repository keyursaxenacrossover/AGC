</em> can be created on any page of the survey project. If the <em>Task Trigger</em> is created on the final page, for example, it will be triggered upon completion of the survey. The <em>Task Trigger</em> is configured on the basis of a selected Employee project storing the required organizational structure and the respective Action module the <em>Task Trigger</em> accesses when triggering the task. A number of conditions and settings define if a task is created and what content is stored in this task. The target unit for a task needs to be provided in a variable of the originating survey. In case a unit cannot be found, a survey runtime error is thrown and the survey‘s error notification recipients will be notified. The survey wildcards can be used to dynamically fill Action Planner variables. Conditions can be defined to provide different content based on predefined rules. Default fields for defining the task cannot be removed and must have a value.</p>
