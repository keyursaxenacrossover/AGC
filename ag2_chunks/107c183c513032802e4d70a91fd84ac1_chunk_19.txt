<em><strong>Org Processor</strong></em><strong> users</strong>
</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><em>EFS Employee</em> allows you to delegate data entry and maintenance for individual organizational units to staff that usually belong to the respective units. Via the separate <em>Org Processor</em> login, these staff members - the so-called users - have access to those <em>Org Processor</em> views and functions required for their work, restricted to their respective areas of responsibility. This chapter tells you how to manage the users of your project in their everyday work.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>The </strong><em><strong>Org Processor</strong></em><strong> from the user’s perspective</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">As a member of the project management, you have an administrator account for <em>EFS Employee</em>. This allows you to log into the admin area of EFS Employee and, for example, configure the survey process, work on the questionnaire, or view the list of participants for the entire project. Staff members who merely maintain or retrieve data of a specific unit have a different type of account: the so-called user account. This account allows them to log into the <em>Org Processor</em> and, within the confines of their role, view and maintain data for their area of responsibility. However, they are not granted access to the admin area. In order to allow the optimum management of these users, you should know how they access the Org Processor and which features are available to them.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">By default, there is always a user account for you in the Org Processor. If you have created the project and activated Logistics, this account is also the person responsible for the default logistics site. You can use this account to test the separate<em> Org Processor</em> login:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>In the<strong> Survey menu</strong> of the project, you see the URL of the questionnaire. Open a second browser window. Copy the URL into the address bar, add /orgprocessor, and click on <strong>Enter</strong>: This opens the<em> Org Processor</em> login.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the menu <strong>Org Processor → Org Processor users</strong>. Locate your user account and open the detail view by clicking on the<strong> Edit</strong> icon. Use the given initial password to log in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">This will take you to the start page of the separate <em>Org Processor</em> area where the users work. Usually, there will be no other tabs activated besides the start page. To activate more tabs, you have to allocate an area of responsibility and a role to your test user. The example below shows the start page of an owner, who can access <strong>Organizational structure</strong>, <strong>Return</strong>, and <strong>Report overview</strong> during the pre-test phase.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Your automatically created user account exists separately from your staff account for the www area of <em>EFS Employee</em>, i.e., the accounts have different<br>passwords, among other things. You can't log into the separate <em>Org Processor</em> area with your staff account.</p>
