<h3 id="faq_1">What happens if I don't set a Content Security Policy?</h3>

<h3 id="faq_2">Why does my custom code fail to load external resources?</h3>
<p>If your custom code is trying to load resources from external domains not specified in the CSP, the browser will block these resources. You need to update the CSP to include these external domains explicitly.</p>
