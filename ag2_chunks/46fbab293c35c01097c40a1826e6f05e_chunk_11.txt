<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The panel group trigger is available in panel surveys and master data surveys. The basic settings are the same as for other trigger types. Additionally, the following settings specific to this type of trigger have to be performed:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Group category</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Target group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trigger mode: You can choose whether the respective panelist is to be added to or removed from the group.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pre-qualification-trigger" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Pre-qualification trigger</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The <em>Pre-Qualification trigger</em> can be used to import participants as panelists. They have to take part in an <em>Anonymous survey</em> (AN), a <em>Personalized survey</em> (PE), <em>Employee survey</em> (ES). The panelists will be created using survey variables. The e-mail address is mandatory. To configure the trigger two tabs are available. You will use the<strong> Settings</strong> and the <strong>Detail configuration</strong> tabs.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">On the <strong>Settings</strong> tab, a name and a short trigger description can be added. Then you have to set up the conditions and check whether the trigger should also be executed in the questionnaire preview and whether it should be executed multiple times in one survey session.</p>
