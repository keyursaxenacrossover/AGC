<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In the long run, the data volumes involved in the sending of emails will put an unnecessary strain on the installation’s performance. Once the project is over, the archived emails are usually not needed ever again. The mail archives will therefore be cleaned automatically at regular intervals: Archived mail will be deleted six months after dispatch (depending on the size of the installation this may be executed earlier).</p>
