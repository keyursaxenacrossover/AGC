<h2 id="standard_restores">Standard Restores</h2>
<p>Standard restores are defined by the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>EFS instance is hosted in GSA2</li>
<li>Date/time of deletion fits GSA2 Backup Policy</li>
<li>Customer should be able to perform the restore independently</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of standard restores include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete projects meeting the above criteria</li>
<li>Survey layouts that can be exported and imported</li>
<li>Mail templates that can be recreated using copy and paste</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="information_checklist">Information Checklist</h2>
<p>Use this checklist to ensure all necessary information is collected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer name</li>
<li>Responsible contact person</li>
<li>EFS instance</li>
<li>Data to be restored</li>
<li>Date of data deletion or loss</li>
<li>Cause of data loss</li>
<li>Desired restoration location</li>
<li>Who will perform the restoration (customer or EFS Technical Support)</li>

<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863">FAQ</h1>
<h3 id="faq_1">What types of data can be restored?</h3>
<p>Various types of data can be restored, including whole projects, respondent data, panelist data, survey layouts, and mail templates. The specific type of data that can be restored depends on the circumstances of the data loss and the backup policies in place.</p>
<h3 id="faq_2">How much does data restoration cost?</h3>
<p>The cost of data restoration varies depending on several factors, including the need for a mirror EFS instance, the complexity of the recovery process, and whether EFS Technical Support needs to perform the restoration. Costs may include setup fees for mirror instances and hourly rates for technical support. Exact costs should be discussed with the support team on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<h3 id="faq_3">Can customers perform data restoration themselves?</h3>
<p>In some cases, especially for standard restores, customers may be able to perform the data restoration themselves. This typically applies to situations where the EFS instance is hosted in GSA2, the deletion date fits the GSA2 Backup Policy, and the type of data lost is relatively straightforward to restore (e.g., survey layouts or mail templates).</p>
