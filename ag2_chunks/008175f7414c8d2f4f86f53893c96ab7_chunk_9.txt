<h2 id="action-board" class="auto-cursor-target wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Action Board</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">To initiate the improvement of engagement, the traditional approaches have been evolved. This development presents the current solution for such applications, the Action Planner, with a challenge. This module uses an organizational structure that restricts the actions to hierarchically coordinated actions and proves inflexible when teams are dynamically assembled. The new improvements module is designed for other use cases. By using the share function, fluctuating team compositions are possible and a commentary function and a lean evaluation option provide the key to sustainable commitment. The measures enacted from above will be replaced by active cooperation.</p>
<h3 id="the-page-integration-of-the-new-module-and-the-first-steps" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>The page integration of the new module and the first steps</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The page module integration in the CMS area of Portals finds no trouble: You place the module Improvements on a page and enter a heading. After that, the module is already available in the exterior view. You use the button “Export list” to export important information in an Excel list. The list contains the information of the persons who created the improvement, with whom it is shared, and who is responsible. The exterior view of the user interface is arranged and easy to handle. The new module offers you a search function and a board that is equipped with the columns “Inbox”, “Ongoing” and “Done”. The three columns help you to document the progress of a ticket. An improvement ticket is created by clicking on the button “Create improvement”. The corresponding ticket is generated in the column “Inbox”. This is furnished with a catchy title by you before the work starts. You sort the tickets horizontally and vertically via drag &amp; drop. Initially, the tickets can be moved back and forth as desired. The improvements are always in the same status for you and every other user.</p>
<h3 id="the-improvement-ticket-and-the-detail-view" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>The improvement ticket and the detailed view</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Each improvement ticket has two icons on the right side of the ticket. They allow a quick orientation, i.e. whether the improvement is already shared and who the person responsible is. Clicking on the ticket or its title gives you access to the detail view. There you share the Improvement with Circles and users who will work on it together, and you also equip the Improvement with a topic in which you can participate using the comment function. Any hierarchy, such as an organizational structure, is omitted. Besides you designate one of the users as the person responsible (assignee) by assigning the ticket to her or him. If you want to be the person responsible (assignee), you use the option to assign yourself the ticket. Another setting option, regarding improvements, can be found on the profile page. Here you can determine what type of notification, push, and/or e-mail you want to receive for what change to an improvement shared with you or for which you are responsible. You can also disable any notification.</p>
<h3 id="the-share-function" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>The share function</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">To keep the share function simple, a distinction is now made between private and public circles. For new circles to be created, but also for existing ones, you determine now whether they are private or public. Circles that have been published cannot be privatized. The default setting for each circle is: private. They share improvements with all public circles and with the panelists who have access to the portal. Under Shared with you can find out with whom the Improvement is shared, and you can revoke your choice if necessary. From the number of panelists you share the improvement with, you assign the improvement to one or another, making the person responsible. This choice can also be revoked, although every improvement requires a responsible person.</p>
<h3 id="adding-categories" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Adding categories</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">For each improvement, you add up to three categories, which you can create in the CMS area of portals on the sub-navigation field Content under the tab Topics. The colors selected for the categories appear on the Improvement Ticket. Subcategories that you also create in the CMS area of Portals are not supported currently.</p>
<h3 id="the-comment-function" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>The comment function</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In the detail view, you comment on an improvement. A profile picture, name, and surname are displayed. By clicking on the name or profile picture you will be forwarded to the profile. The time of the comment is also displayed. Besides the possibility to enter a text, paste a video link, and upload a photo, comments can be answered. If you have activated it, you will be notified by e-mail or push notification when an improvement has been commented on.</p>
