<h3 id="01J3YV9D4FCT7541MYKX99DNQ2">What is SSL?</h3>
<p>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a protocol that ensures encrypted data transmission over the Internet.</p>
<h3 id="01J3YV9D4FQ6Z5E3FVCGHS12Q7">How do I know if a domain already has SSL?</h3>
<p>Enter the domain with https:// in your browser's address bar. If there's no error message and you see a green lock next to the URL, the domain has SSL.</p>
<h3 id="01J3YV9D4F46J292RCYV9V4TTE">What is an Alias?</h3>
<p>An alias is a second domain name for an existing website. For example, if the generic domain is ab1234.customervoice360.com, an alias could be i-love-kitkat.com. The alias points to the generic domain, displaying the same page.</p>
<h3 id="custom_url_alias">What is a "custom URL Alias managed by Tivian"?</h3>
<p>This likely refers to sub-domains of a customer's main domain (e.g., www.kundendomain.de, umfrage.kundendomain.de) managed by Tivian. These should be treated as separate aliases due to potential for unlimited sub-domains.</p>
<h3 id="scenario_costs">What are the costs associated with different scenarios?</h3>
<p>Costs vary depending on the scenario, including domain registration, renewal, SSL certificates, and additional setup processes. Scenario 1 incurs the least costs, while Scenario 4 is preferred by Tivian for maximum control and minimal customer communication.</p>
