<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If you want to integrate a blog list into the website, please proceed as follows:</p>
<ol class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>On the desired page, create a page module of the “Teaser” type.<br>– In many cases, teasers will be created on the dedicated „GLOBAL“ page and referenced.</li>
<li>Configure the setting options as required.<br>– Select the “func_teaser” module template.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="forums" class="sc-iGrrsa eYmPYl wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Forums</strong></h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The forum discussion is one of the most frequently used qualitative feedback collection methods. Therefore, this feature is quite closely integrated with EFS’s central standard functions.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>Forum discussions can be created and managed as separate projects from within the project list.</li>
<li>The to-do list allows to display of forum discussions along with quantitative surveys on the panelists’ personal homepages.</li>
<li>You can decide for yourself whether you want to use these display options. If you wish to use them, open the dialog Edit settings for all forum topics which are to be displayed and tick the checkbox “Treat as qualitative project”. If you create your forum topics from within the project list, this option will be enabled automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">For designing and operating forums, EFS opens up a wide variety of possibilities:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>You can use the “Forum” function module to position one or more forums on a panel page. There can be forum discussions on several topics on each forum.</li>
<li>There are several levels:<strong> Forum discussions &gt; Topics &gt; Threads &gt; Posts</strong>. Threads can be started by the panelists themselves. If necessary, you can lock them, keeping the content accessible but blocking further posts.</li>
<li>New contributions and those made by moderators are specially marked.</li>
<li>The visibility of key posts can be improved by “stickying” them above the thread.</li>
<li>From EFS 10.3, it is possible to create a teaser that automatically displays the most recent, best rated, or most frequently rated forum threads or posts.</li>
<li>You can award bonus points for participation in forum discussions.</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally, you can allow panelists to upload files to illustrate their posts. Just a few clicks are necessary to set up appealing image galleries. Furthermore, tags can be used to insert multimedia content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can either allow all visitors to read forum posts, only permit logged-in panelists to do so, or even restrict access to certain panel groups. As a rule, only logged-on panelists can post contributions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use a panelist account with the special “Moderator” or “Tester” status to act as a moderator in forum discussions,. If you post using such an account from the admin area, you can make use of various additional features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can create separate forums for each language version of the website(s). Copying a language version also copies the related forum. However, the posts belonging to these forums are not copied, as this is usually not advisable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use the “func_forum” template to structure the forum layout as desired. In the standard panel, which, as usual, serves as an example in the following chapters, the layout is kept simple to make editing easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can create as many forums as you like. Please mind, though, that the resulting amounts of data may affect the performance of the panel installation.<br>– Please use the following guiding values for orientation: At most 50 topics per forum, at most 100 threads per topic, at most 25 post levels inside a thread, and most 1,000 posts per thread.<br>– Furthermore, you can export the posts of old forums resp. topics and subsequently delete the forums resp. topics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Forums are maintained with the help of a specially developed optimized GUI. This means that a user who is not familiar with the CMS can take over their maintenance without requiring a great deal of training.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">This chapter shows you how to create bulletin boards and moderate discussions from the admin area:</p>
