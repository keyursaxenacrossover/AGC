 color of the time display of tasks turns from black to orange as soon as a task is one day away from expiration. In the configuration area, you can define the number of days the reminder function is executed before expiration. Here, you can adjust the default setting of one day.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">There are three different colors displaying the time status of tasks:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Black: The task is at least one day away from expiration warning. By default, the warning is executed one day before expiration of the task. In this case, the task is marked in black up to two days before expiration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orange: The task is one day away from expiration with default setting or at the most as many days as is set for the expiration warning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red: The task is expired and lies in the past.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The setting of the expiration warning runs by days (not time). Tasks expire at 11.59 pm at night (UTC). Expired tasks are automatically escalated one level up.</p>
