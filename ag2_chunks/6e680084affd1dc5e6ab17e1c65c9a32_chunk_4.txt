<h3 id="header-26">A new column in the report order table</h3>
<p>The report order table (under the tab report orders) obtains the new column “Order State”. By the means of this update, it is possible to depict the four different order statuses clearly:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<p>Created</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Progress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Done</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cancelled</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Each order is initially set to the status “Created”.</p>
<h3 id="header-27">Report order management and control</h3>
<p>The report order management gives you direct access to the processing of an order. This saves you time, especially in the case of orders that contain large quantities of reports to be generated. If a report definition turns to be in need of correction, the report order management allows you to cancel and to delete the corresponding order. Of course, you are able to pause an order and check any possible changes before placing it. You continue the processing with “Resume”.</p>
<p>By mouse over, the icon available in the respective order status appear in the row of the report order table. Not all actions are available in each status. Accordingly, the icons of the non-executable actions are not displayed. All in all, you have the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pause</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resume</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cancel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="header-28">Improvements for the tables: refresh button and fixed header</h3>
<p>The report table, the report order table and the report distribution table obtain a refresh button.</p>
<p>A scrolling header provides a better overview of the report order table and the report distribution table: the header of the table remains in screen when you scroll.</p>
