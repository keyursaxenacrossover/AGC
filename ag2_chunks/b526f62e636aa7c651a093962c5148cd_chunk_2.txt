<p>There are domains that can actually registered via a domain registrar, e.g. above.</p>
<h4 id="sub-domains">Sub-Domains</h4>
<pre><code class="language-text">test.example.com
another.test.example.com
more.stuff.org</code></pre>
<p>This is any domain situated hierarchically below an Apex-Domain, e.g. above.</p>
<h3 id="dsn-record-types">DNS Record Types</h3>
<p>The following only describes a limited number of Record Types, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types</a> for a more exhaustive list.</p>
<h4 id="a-aaaa">A / AAAA</h4>
<p>This record is used for depositing an IPv4 / IPv6 respectively and is usually used for IP-Resolution when browsing websites.</p>
<p>The value of such a record will contain only the IP in the corresponding format:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">example.com IN A 192.168.4.2
example.com IN AAAA c70c:3973:f12e:de58:3398:9d3a:5b07:6d20</code></pre>
<h4 id="mx">MX</h4>
<p>This record pertains to the shipping of emails and denotes one or more servers that are responsible for receiving Email for this domain.</p>
<p>The value of such a record contains 2 parts (see example below):</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<p>Priority value: lover value → higher priority</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Host-Name: This must resolve to an IP (A- / AAAA-Record) and <strong>never</strong> a CNAME-Record</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-text">example.com IN MX 10 mail.example.com.
example.com IN MX 20 other-mail.example.com.</code></pre>
<h4 id="cname">CNAME</h4>
<p>This records maps the respective domain to another (Then canonical one). It must <strong>never </strong>be used on an Apex-Domain.</p>
<p>In practice when a domain-query resolves to a CNAME, the query is then restarted against the denoted “canonical” domain and that result is returned instead. The only exception is when querying for a CNAME record, in which case the actual record showing the deposited “canonical” domain is returned.</p>
<p>The value of such a record will contain only the “canonical” domain, e.g. :</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">some.example.com IN CNAME example.com.
another.example.com IN CNAME 10 another.example.org.</code></pre>
<h4 id="txt">TXT</h4>
<p>This record allows for arbitrary text to be associated with a domain and there may be one or more such records deposited for a single domain, depending on the implementation of the DNS-Server.</p>
<p>In practice this is mainly, but not exclusively, used for SSL-DNS-Challenges and a number of Email-related standards each with their own specifications on how the contents of the record need to be structured.</p>
<p>The value of such a record will contain the intended string wrapped in <strong>“</strong>, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">some.example.com IN TXT "this is some text"
some.example.com IN TXT "v=spf1 mx -all"</code></pre>
<h4 id="ns">NS</h4>
<p>This record allows the domain-administrator to specify the Name-Server against which DNS-Queries of the domain should be executed. This can be used to transfer the administrative control over the DNS-Records to another party without having to transfer the whole domain ownership.</p>
<p>These exist on any domain and per default will point to the name server of the DNS provider at which the domain is registered. If set on a subdomain it will behave similar to a CNAME-Record but instead of pointing to an existing domain, the target domain has be recreated at the Target-Nameserver.</p>
<p>The value of such a record will contain the Hostname of the Target-Nameserver, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">example.com IN NS some.name-server.io
another.example.com IN NS another.name-server.com</code></pre>
<h4 id="alias-aname-cname-flattening-non-standard-virtual-record">ALIAS / ANAME / CNAME Flattening (non-standard / virtual-record)</h4>
<p>This record combines the benefits of both a CNAME and an A- / AAAA-Record and is mainly used for, but not limited to, pointing an Apex-Domain to a CDN (Content Delivery Network) or a high available load-balanced setup in AWS.</p>
<p>It is non-standard, meaning there is now official RFC for this (yet), and virtual, meaning that it appears in configuration only and is being presented as a A- / AAAA-Record instead when queried. Also due to it being non-standard there is no official name for it, but it is often called either “ALIAS” or “ANAME” inside the configuration-interface of a DNS-Provider that supports it.</p>
<p>A provider implementing this kind of record, does so by involving a resolving name-server when answering a DNS-Query to get the A- / AAAA-Records of the deposited FQDN, which are then returned in kind (see image below). In practice some form
