<h2 id="selecting-question-types">Selecting question types</h2>
<p>There are three main types of questions commonly used in surveys:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Closed-ended questions:</strong> Respondents select from pre-defined options. These are quick to answer and easy to analyze but may not cover all possible responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open-ended questions:</strong> Respondents provide answers in their own words. These can yield surprising and useful insights but are more labor-intensive to analyze.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Combination of closed-ended and open-ended questions:</strong> This approach increases the likelihood of capturing all possible answers and is useful when you're unsure if all response options are covered.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="forming-the-questions">Forming the Questions</h2>
<p>Properly formed questions are crucial for gathering valid data and drawing accurate conclusions. The following sections outline important elements to consider when creating survey questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="language-use">Language use in the questionnaire</h2>
<p>The language used in a survey is critical. Questions should have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Relevant to a clearly defined problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple and conversational in tone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unambiguous and not open to misinterpretation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not offensive or inflammatory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Free of slang, abbreviations, or specialist terminology</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="one-vs-several-answers">One possible answer vs. several possible answers</h2>
<p>Be clear about whether a question should have one or multiple possible answers. Avoid confusion by explicitly stating when multiple selections are allowed.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="non-leading-questions">Non-leading questions</h2>
<p>Ensure questions are as neutral as possible and do not lead respondents to specific answers. Avoid including assumptions or biases in the question wording.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="mutually-exclusive">Mutually exclusive response options</h2>
<p>When providing multiple-choice options, ensure that the choices are mutually exclusive. For example, when asking about age ranges, make sure the ranges don't overlap:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Below 20 years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>20-29 years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>30-39 years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>40-49 years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50 years or older</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="collective-exhaustive">Collective exhaustive response options</h2>
<p>Ensure that response options cover all possible answers a respondent might give. Include options like "Other" or "Don't know" when appropriate to capture all potential responses.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="correlation">Correlation between questions and response options</h2>
<p>Maintain consistency between the phrasing of the question and the response options. This prevents misunderstandings and ensures the validity of the results.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="dont-assume">Don't take anything for granted</h2>
<p>Allow respondents the option to indicate that they don't know or don't have an opinion. Be aware that words and concepts can mean different things to different individuals or groups.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="one-thing-at-a-time">Ask about one thing at a time</h2>
<p>Avoid asking about multiple issues in a single question. This can lead to confusion and make it difficult to interpret the results accurately.</p>
