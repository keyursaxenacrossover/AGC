<p data-renderer-start-pos="3217">Communication with the client will be they key, since they user experience with the sync is highly dependant on the client setup within Tivian</p>

<p data-renderer-start-pos="3400">This depends highly on the amount of users in the installation(s) and if they are using their company’s Identity Provider (since those users don’t need to be synced)<strong data-renderer-mark="true">.</strong></p>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="3568">Syncing a few (&lt;100) EFS Admin users should not take more than a few seconds.</p>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="3647">If a million panelist users needs to be synced, this could possibly take hours.</p>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="3728">The limiting factor to this will be the Okta API rate limit which is set to 600 user creations a minute (shared across all Okta applications)</p>
<h4 id="When-should-I-start-the-user-migration-?" data-renderer-start-pos="3871"><strong data-renderer-mark="true">When should I start the user migration ?</strong></h4>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="3913">To answer this you have to think about the following:</p>
<ul class="ak-ul" data-indent-level="1">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="3970">During migration users receive an activation mail from Okta. Do the users expect such an email ? When can they start using their Okta account (Tivian Access is completely activated on the EFS installation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="4179">Activating Tivian Access without the user sync (and assuming no Identity Provider is used for federation) will have the effect that users can not sign in to EFS anymore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="4352"><strong data-renderer-mark="true">To conclude</strong>: Migration has to happen before the activation of Tivian Access (for all users which are not using their company’s Identity Provider). If it happens too early, it will cause a potential bad user experience.</p>
