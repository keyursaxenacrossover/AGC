<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The analysis of survey data is determined by the survey's purpose. It's crucial to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Align the interpretation with the survey's intended goals</li>
<li>Ensure that the chosen questions effectively highlight the problems addressed by the survey</li>

</ul>
<p>By focusing on these aspects, any measures implemented based on the survey results will be goal-oriented and effective.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="analyzing-results">Analyzing the Results</h2>
<p>The analysis process may involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced statistical calculations</li>
<li>Simple overviews of response frequencies</li>
<li>Subjective interpretations</li>
</ul>
<p>Key considerations for data analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Break down data into smaller, practical sub-groups</li>
<li>Maintain respondent anonymity</li>
<li>Avoid basing conclusions on individual answers</li>
<li>Ensure a sufficient sample size for comprehensive breakdowns (at least 5 respondents per group)</li>
</ul>
<p>After completing the analyses, draw conclusions at an overall level and decide on measures to implement. Consider incorporating data from other sources to support your decisions.</p>
