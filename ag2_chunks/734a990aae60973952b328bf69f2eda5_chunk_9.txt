<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Searching the sample</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">To search sample members you can use the usual simple search. However, via extended search, you can use additional limitation criteria:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Always available for selection are panel status and the participant’s status in the sample.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have used stratification, the stratification variables can be used as search criteria, too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Editing options</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">A range of participant administration actions are available for editing sample members, such as, for example, the dispatching of e-mails to selected participants, or resetting with or without deleting data.</p>

<h2 id="inviting-and-reminding-sample-members" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Inviting and reminding sample members</strong></h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Dedicated tabs allow you to e-mail the sample members in a centralized manner during various work phases:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p><strong>Inform</strong>: This tab is displayed after creating a new sample. You can use it to reach all participants with disposition codes 11, 12, 20, and 22.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inform again</strong>: This tab is displayed after sending the first invitation e-mail. You can use it to reach all participants with disposition codes 11, 12, 20, and 22.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remind again</strong>: This tab is visible after creating a new sample. After sending the first invitation e-mail, it is activated.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>By default, reminders are sent to participants with disposition codes 11, 12, 20, and 22.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A drop-down list below the mail form allows you to optionally specify the disposition code of the recipients yourself. You can choose from the codes 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, or 23.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Import links</strong>: Opens the import dialog.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The CSV file must contain the survey link in the first column and the URL has to start with the protocol (http:// or https://), the placeholder #panel_url#, or any other placeholder specifying the protocol. Optionally you may add the panelists’ pseudonym, <em>u_account</em>,<
