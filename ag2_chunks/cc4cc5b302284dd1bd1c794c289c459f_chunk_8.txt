 in your online survey. You may either enter participants manually or import the list of participants into<em> EFS</em> in an Excel sheet (CSV file). There are various options for how to restrict access to the survey. For example, using a password sent to the participants via e-mail, or via a personalized link or definable IP addresses. The respective passwords for participants can be either generated within<em> the EFS Survey</em> or imported into the system.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Employee Surveys (ES)</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The project-type Employee survey is used only on <em>EFS Employee</em> installations. It satisfies particularly strict data protection guidelines and allows access to the optionally available additional tool Org Processor.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Multi-Source Feedbacks (MSF)</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><em>Multi-source feedbacks</em> allow us to realize complex multi-rater feedback processes, e.g. 360° leadership surveys.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Panel Surveys (PA)</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><em>Panel surveys</em> are answered by persons registered as participants within your panel. In order to perform panel surveys you must generate groups in the People module. Samples are then drawn from these groups for the survey project of your panel.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Master Data Surveys (MD)</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The project-type <em>Master data survey</em> is also closely connected with the panel. Master data are basic information collected on panel members at the beginning of panel membership. In addition to socio-demographic details, such as income and occupation, you can collect as much information as required, depending on the interests of the panel operator. The master data survey is usually the first survey to be completed by each panelist, following registration.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Forum Discussions (FD)</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The <em>forum discussion</em> is one of the most frequently used qualitative feedback collection methods. It is strongly used, in particular, in Insight Communities. Therefore, a dedicated project-type <em>Forum discussion</em> is available. In analogy to the familiar survey projects, you can create forum discussions as separate projects and organize them via the Projects menu.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-project-type" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Changing the Project Type</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Retrospective changing of the project type is restricted to anonymous and personalized projects. I.e. you can change an anonymous survey into a personalized survey and vice versa. However, due to various restrictions, changing the project type is usually only sensible if the project has only just been created or if you have copied an old project to reuse the questionnaire.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The following restrictions apply:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>If a personalized project is converted to an anonymous project, all settings and contents of participant administration are lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All result data already available will be deleted in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reports which have been configured and/or generated in Reporting will be deleted irrevocably.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">To change the project type, open the <strong>Survey menu</strong> and click on the <strong>Change</strong> icon in the “Project type” field. This brings you to the dialog where you can change the project type. <em>Employee surveys</em>, <em>Multi-source feedback</em>, <em>Panel surveys</em>,<em> Master data surveys,</em> and <em>Forum discussions</em> cannot be converted into any other project type.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>To re-use a questionnaire in a project type that does not allow a conversion, please use page import.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="copying-projects" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Copying Projects</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can create copies of projects at any time. Projects may also be copied if you possess read rights. Users with read rights only may edit copied projects, but never original projects.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>Contents of questionnaires, layout settings and general project attributes will be copied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A change of the project type during the copying process is restricted to anonymous and personalized projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision for a layout generation and version made in the source project - i.e. "Responsive Layout 3", “Responsive Layout 2”, “Responsive Layout 1” or classic system layout - will be transferred when copying. A switch in the copied project is not possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Result data that already exist, sample definitions (e.g. contents of participant administration in personalized
