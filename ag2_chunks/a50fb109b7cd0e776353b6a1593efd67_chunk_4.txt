 master data surveys, you may also use panel-specific data such as master data or performance data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data collected outside of <em>EFS</em> can be imported as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Up to 100 additional external variables can be generated via import and filled with data.</p>

<li>
<p>A report may contain up to 50,000 data records.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The complexity of a report depends on both the number of variables and the number of data records. Depending on the size of these two factors, you may experience extended calculation times below the thresholds mentioned above.</p>
