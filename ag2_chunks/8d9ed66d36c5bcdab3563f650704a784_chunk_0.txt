<p><strong><span style="color: rgb(255,153,31);">Decisions taken for Winter Release 2019:</span></strong></p><p></p><p>The IAM solution will be created using Okta. The contract with Okta will start on January 2020. The production account for Okta will be available on January 2020.</p><p></p><p><strong><u>Focused Client Group:</u></strong></p><p>Clients are focused that meet the following criteria:</p><ul>
<li><p>Clients having their own IdP</p></li>
<li><p>Clients having managed (IdP) users in Portals</p></li>
<li><p>Clients using EFS Admin and Portals only</p></li>
</ul><p></p><p><strong><u>Requirements for Clients:</u></strong></p><p>The focused group of clients have to match some requirements to enable IAM.</p><ul>
<li><p>The IdP can be accessed from outside/the internet (like Okta, Auth0, Azure AD)</p></li>
<li><p>The IdP can be federated based on SAML 2 or OpenID Connect</p></li>
<li><p><del>The clients do only have managed users  in Portals</del></p></li>
<li><p>The client has to have the newest version of EFS (19.5)</p></li>
<li><p>The IdP offers users based on email-addresses and will provide first and last name of the users</p></li>
<li><p>Customization has to be adaptable to the new module</p></li>
<li><p>The installations have to use HTTPS and not http (Added on 16.01.2020)</p></li>
</ul><p></p><p><strong><u>Impact on other features when activating IAM module: </u></strong></p><ul>
<li><p>Changing the email-address is not possible without a time consuming request to our support and manual processes</p></li>
<li><p>Password changes will be handled in Okta</p></li>
<li><p><del>Inviting external people to Portals is not possible anymore</del></p></li>
<li><p>Authorization is still handled in the respective application - EFS or Portals (only authentication will be handled by the current IAM solution)</p></li>
<li><p>Importing big numbers of user might take additional time in case IAM is active due to user also being synchronized with Okta. This occurs due to a rate limit in Okta APIs. In case IAM is active it might make sense to decrease the import limit and increase it in case admin know the consequences.</p></li>
</ul><p></p><p><strong><u>Decisions on specific features:</u></strong></p><ul>
<li><p>Migration: All panelists will be migrated if necessary (see below).</p></li>
<li><p>Customization: Customization is out of scope for the first phase of the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Panelists can be excluded from SSO entirely (see below). <ac:emoticon ac:emoji-fallback=":question_mark:" ac:emoji-id="atlassian-question_mark" ac:emoji-shortname=":question_mark:" ac:name="question"></ac:emoticon></p></li>

Therefore the first clients should be picked carefully. Clients with a huge number of users are a risky way to learn what our solution is capable of and might cause issues during migration. Take this into consideration before selecting clients.</del></p><p>All EFS Admin users and Panelists will be migrated. This might take some time. But it is scheduled asynchronously and has a natural limit for big migrations. If there is an incident we should ask Okta to raise their API limit for this specific use case.</p><p></p><p><strong><u>New decision from 25.11.2019</u></strong></p><p>There will be a contract with Okta.</p><p></p><p><strong><u>New business decision from 25.11.2019</u></strong></p><p><u>Panelwebsite and SSO for EFS Admin only.</u></p><p>Add a setting to
