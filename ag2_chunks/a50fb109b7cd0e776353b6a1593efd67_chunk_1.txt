<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">When you create a report, the current questionnaire structure and the existing result data of the respective project will be transferred into<em> EFS Reporting+</em>. If you have made any subsequent changes to the questionnaire or if additional respondents have participated after creating your report, you can manually update it. This update includes:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>The latest result data of the project will be included in the report.</p>

<li>

Once the project status has changed to “inactive”, “finished” or “archived”, the update is triggered one last time. Afterward, the rule will be deleted and the automated update deactivated.</p>
