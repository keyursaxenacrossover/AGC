 the surveys, and sort the view by creation date. </span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The status of a survey is labeled with an according <strong>color bar</strong> at the top of each tile:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>Blue bar: The survey has not started yet</li>
<li>Green bar: The survey has started.</li>
<li>Yellow bar: The survey will soon be closed.</li>
<li>Red bar: The survey is closed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In the right upper corner of each tile, the remaining time until the expiration of the survey is viewable.</p>
<h3 id="envelope-icon" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Envelope icon</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Via the envelope icon, you can send invitations and reminder emails. The color of the envelope labels type and status of the dispatch:</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>Red envelope: The invitation mail is not controlled by a timer and therefore still has to be sent manually.</li>
<li>Green envelope: After the dispatch of the invitation, reminder mail can be sent manually.</li>
<li>Gray envelope(not clickable): The invitation has been sent. No reminder emails can be sent.</li>
<li>Yellow envelope: The invitation mail is controlled by a timer and will be sent automatically at the set time. You also can send it manually.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dashboard-icon" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Dashboard icon</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">If a <em>MySight</em> project is linked to the related template project, a dashboard icon will be visible on the tile. Via this icon, you can forward survey dashboards to survey participants via e-mail and export your dashboards as PDFs and images. If you decide to forward by e-mail, the standard mail client opens. The recipient line contains all participants of the survey.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">By activating the respective checkbox in the CMS of the <em>Feedback Assistant</em> module, you can <strong>only allow access to the dashboard at the end of the wave</strong>. If this function is active, the dashboard icon on the tile will be hidden throughout the whole term of the survey, so you won‘t have access to the related dashboard until the closure of the survey.</p>
<h3 id="list-of-participants" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>List of participants</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">By clicking on the banderole in the middle of the tile or optionally on the list icon, you get to the list of participants displaying the invitation status of survey participants in an overview. Also, you can export participants from here.</p>
<h3 id="tile-menu" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify"><strong>Tile menu</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Via the (three-dots-) tile menu icon, you can <strong>edit</strong> your surveys, for example, change the title and end date or add and remove participants. The template cannot be changed via this menu, however.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Also, you can copy your surveys. By doing so, the data of the original survey will be transferred automatically to the copy of the survey. However, data controlled by a timer and the end date will have to be defined again for copied surveys.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Furthermore, you can Delete and Finish your surveys. By finishing a survey, you can close it early to prevent any further participation.</p>
