<h3 id="downloading-files-from-media-library" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Downloading Files from the Media Library</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Individual or several files can be downloaded. For this purpose, a <strong>Download</strong> icon is available on every level of the category structure on the <strong>Current Project</strong> and<strong> Common library</strong> tabs. If you select the desired files and click this icon, a zip file will be generated that contains the content of the current folder including its subfolders. You can save this file locally to a PC, open it, and then view or edit the images.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">When working in the installation-wide media library, in particular, take care to select only reasonable amounts of data for download, i.e. less than 10 MB and not more than 30 files. Otherwise, the download process can affect the performance of the <em>EFS</em> installation.</p>
<h4 id="protecting-images" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Protecting Images</h4>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Customers running product or cover tests frequently ask for better protection against illegal copying and screenshotting of their content. A dedicated image protection feature makes storing or screenshotting images considerably more difficult.</p>
<ul class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">
<li>
<p>In the questionnaire, participants will see only the silhouette and outline of the protected image, plus an instruction for display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the participants press the key combination specified in the instruction, the image will be displayed. (They have to keep the blank key pressed and click on the image with the left key of the mouse pointer.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">For technical reasons, it is not possible to prevent participants from taking screenshots or from downloading the displayed images on their hard disks with absolute reliability. But with the new image protection feature, it is considerably more difficult.</p>

<h2 id="common-library" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Common Library</h2>

<li>
<p>It is recommended to create not more than 250 folders.</p>

<h2 id="tivian-library" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Tivian Library</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">From EFS 10.0, the Tivian library provides ready-made visuals, made available by Tivian for free. This includes, among others, a comprehensive repertoire of icons and other image files for the new question types. The Tivian library content is read-only: the used content will only be referenced in an effective, resource-saving manner instead of copying into the project.</p>

<h3 id="faq_file_types" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">What file types can I upload to the Media Library?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">You can upload various file types including images, SVG graphics, flash, and video formats such as RealVideo or Quicktime. For a detailed list of permitted file types, click on the <strong>Question mark</strong> icon in the <strong>Upload file</strong> dialog.</p>
<h3 id="faq_file_size" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Is there a file size limit for uploads?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The maximum file size is installation-specific. If you exceed the threshold value, a note will be displayed. You can use zip files to compress larger files or multiple files for easier uploading.</p>
<h3 id="faq_image_protection" class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">How effective is the image protection feature?</h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">While the image protection feature makes it considerably more difficult for participants to take screenshots or download images, it cannot prevent these actions with absolute reliability due to technical limitations.</p>
