</li>
<li>
<p>Icon for active stars / inactive stars: If you want to use other icons, simply click on the default icons. Then, you can select the desired files from the media library.</p>

<h4 id="other-standard-and-scale-matrices">Other standard and scale matrices</h4>
<p><em>The survey</em> provides three further question types which merely differ from question type 311 in their layout. The use of inside titles is not possible with these question types.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Standard matrix 2, question type 312:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The answers appear next to the respective radio buttons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display on mobile devices: You can optionally use a drop-down list instead of the usual list of radio buttons.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these alternatives is especially recommended when a matrix question becomes so long that the respondent has to scroll. That is because, with question types 312, 321, and 322, the text of the scale is displayed with each question and does not disappear from view during scrolling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When using this question type, please note the following particularity concerning the display of questions with more than 6 scale options. If you set 6 scale options, all options are displayed properly.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>If you set 7 scale options or more, the participant can only display them by hovering over the respective selection field:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Available question options vary slightly from question type 311. Use of “Answer option + text” and inside titles is not possible. Also, some other 311 question options such as, for example, vertical flips are not available for some of these question types as they do not make sense in the changed layout.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-differential">Semantic Differential</h3>
<p>A special form of matrix question is the so-called semantic differential.</p>
<h4 id="base-elements-14">Base Elements</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question text</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill-in instruction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help text</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional: Scale options 1-m</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional: Title left pole / right pole</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Answer options 1-n left pole / right pole</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional: Inside titles 1-o</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The semantic differential cannot be used as a source or target question for a list.</p>
<h4 id="question-options-1">Question Options</h4>
<p>The following specific options are available for designing a semantic differential:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only in projects with classic system layout: Width of the left column with the question texts (in pixels): This feature allows you to specify the width of the poles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only in projects with classic system layout: Width of a scale property (in pixels): The width of the scale characteristics can be changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show scale: After you have ticked the checkbox and clicked on <strong>Save</strong>, a scale will be displayed above the radio buttons. As usual with matrix questions, this scale is edited in the “Scale” section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Title left / right pole: This feature allows you to insert headers above the answer options.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With question type 340, you have the option of modifying the area between the question and the answer block by inserting an additional template, e.g. to change the distance.</p>
<h3 id="drop-down-matrix">Drop-down matrix</h3>
<p>This question type can be used to ask questions for which different time states (e.g. for certain university years) or different factual aspects (e.g. geographical limits, such as continents) are given. The time-based or factual differentiation is reflected in the column. The question itself is documented in the row. The following is an example from a survey conducted to assess lectures.</p>
<p>There are two question types which allow you to create a drop-down matrix:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The figure above shows a normal drop-down matrix (question type 361).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, you can create a vertical drop-down matrix (question type 364), i.e. a mirrored version of question type 361.</p>
</li>
