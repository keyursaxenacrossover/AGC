<h1 id="h_01HGKSMPRSER9ENY5QWWRZZ863">FAQ</h1>
<h3 id="faq_1">What data is not included in a standard project export?</h3>
<p>Participant data, result data, installation-related contents (e.g., scale or question library), upload question type data, and Reporting+ reports are not included in a standard project export.</p>
<h3 id="faq_2">Can I export mail templates with the project?</h3>
<p>Mail templates can be exported separately via [Libraries Mail templates] from version 20.x of EFS.</p>
<h3 id="faq_3">Should I always export files from the "Shared Library"?</h3>
<p>You should only export files from the "Shared Library" if images from this library have been used in your project. Otherwise, it's best to leave this option unselected to avoid creating unnecessarily large export files.</p>
