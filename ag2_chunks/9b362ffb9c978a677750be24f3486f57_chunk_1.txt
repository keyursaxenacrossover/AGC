<p>From EFS 22.1 on the domain-aliases will be respected in login resp. logout redirectURL so it is important to maintain the list of redirectURL’s in application up-to-date. The portal-specific applications (created by EFS at creation of a new portal) will contain proper redirectURL’s for each domain-alias registered in EFS (Options / Domains). Additionally, the migration script has an option “Portal update (e.g. update redirects after creation of new domain-alias)”. This option should be used to migrate already existing portal-specific applications with redirectURL’s for all domain-aliases registered in EFS.</p>
