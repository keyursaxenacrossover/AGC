<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>For all intents and purposes of this training:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Project = Survey (legacy Tivian team and even customers may refer to a project as a "survey")</li>
<li>Globalpark = Questback = EFS = Tivian XI = DXI (the product has undergone multiple rebrandings overtime)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20327003733138" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DXI Glossary</a> will help you go through the terms that you are not familiar with while learning the product, so it is best to keep this handy for easy reference.</p>
<p>Before going deeper, please review the below resources that should give you an overall idea of what DXI is, and overall architecture of the product, so you have a better starting point:</p>

</ul>
<p>As you may have inferred from the above articles/s, <strong>DXI is organized in modules</strong>, each serving a different purpose, so we will take them one by one. But first... ü•Å</p>
<h2 id="h_01J2GKEY21W8T3JMMC2SYAC8S2">Create your own user</h2>
<p>In <strong>PasswordState</strong>, there is a shared user for this activity (<strong>shared_support</strong>). So go to Password state to snatch the credentials, and then proceed to creating your own user, as guided in <a href="https://discoverxi-supportdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20304634869650-Account-Team-Organization-Management-in-EFS#create-user-accounts">Account, Team, Organization Management in EFS</a>, with the following options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Username to match your DF AD</li>
<li>Your Trilogy email</li>
<li>Mark <strong>all teams</strong>
</li>
<li>Primary team: <strong>System</strong> <strong>Administrator</strong>
</li>
<li>Organization: <strong>TIVIAN</strong>
</li>
<li>Select your time zone</li>
</ol>
<p>Once that is done, <strong>logout of the shared user</strong>, and then <strong>login with your fresh account</strong> to get tackle the training.</p>
<p><em><strong>Make sure you bookmark that instance URL, as that will be our internal training and test instance.</strong></em></p>
<p>Best learning path is hands-on, so we'll dive right into things.</p>
